## Key Mechanics

### Dividing Wing
Two players will be marked with Tethers, these are baited wide cleaves, direct these SE and SW from respective wings.

One support and One DPS will be marked with large AOE, take each north, Support Left, DPS Right. Remaining players forms a triangle with them in the AOE. 

After tethers resolve, each tether player moves directly north to run through the webs connecting the other players to free them.

![243142856-a01ed7d8-db15-42fc-9f0d-22e7080aa052.webp](/images/p10s-webbaits.webp)

::: info NOTE
It is important to make sure the two circle AOEs are not touching otherwise the tethers will be unbreakable.
:::

### Pandaemon's Holy or Circles of Pandaemonium
Boss will use one of two mechanics:

**Circles of Pandaemonium** (move IN near boss)

![243143017-61148115-f7c2-4e5e-8a94-700ef3f3a03f.webp](/images/p10s-donut.webp)

**Pandaemon's Holy** (move OUT away from boss)

![243143041-b29a601a-dd5f-4ee2-bd7b-a21a5c9b5d90.webp](/images/p10s-out.webp)

### Wicked Step
Two tank-buster towers will appear, launching the tanks to opposing corners. 

Stand where the boss target circle intersects the red AOE arrows of the tower to land it correctly.

After this, the boss will use Entangling Web, One Healer and One DPS along with both tanks will get an AOE, the goal is to build a bridge by touching the AOE with each tank. 

- DPS match with the RIGHT tank.
- Healer match with the LEFT tank.

![243142879-592952f2-7425-495b-9e10-68751537f706.webp](/images/p10s-webs.webp)

Once the AOEs execute, two bridges will appear and the tanks can return to the middle platform.

### Pandaemoniac Pillars
Eight pillars will spawn, these must be soaked by a player each, use the macro for positions:

![243142919-d7be0f8b-9794-45c2-a50c-aac7c6859064.webp](/images/p10s-towers.webp)

```markdown
■【Pandemoniac Pillars】
　　MT  H1  ST
　　D1  H2  D2　　※ Circles In
　　D3      D4　　※ Holy Out
```

Pillars are followed by a **Holy** or **Circle** (In/Out Mechanic) and each tower will become either a dynamo or chariot AOE.

After the towers are soaked, look for **Holy** or **Circle** and then look at the creatures that spawn above each tower.

**Jellyfish** = Dynamo (Donut AOE)

![243143125-8f68557f-9d1b-4e66-be1e-9bc2edb8b84f.webp](/images/p10s-jelly.webp)

**Spikey Thing** = Chariot (Normal AOE)

![243143134-d7500d6f-a50b-48f9-a004-34898bca4b2a.webp](/images/p10s-chain.webp)

Each row will have 2 and 1 of each, for example, two dynamo and one chariot.

The following are some examples of possible patterns:

### Silkspit

All players will be targetted with an AOE, move to dedicated spread positions as per Macro.

![243143583-0aa22a53-7da5-4837-97a7-27db9a2d6298.webp](/images/p10s-spreads.webp)

### Demoniac Binds

Boss will apply debuffs to all players, pay attention to the timers are icons as these will solve later. 

- Single AOE
- Partner AOE
- Party Stack AOE

Count the number of heads in the AOE to understand if it is a Partner/Party stack.

This will resolve later as two mechanics in quick succession, such as Spread > Roles 

```markdown
■【Demonic Bonds】
　　※ 1 Platform Roles
　　 → Pairs ←
　　MT　　　D1　↓
　　ST　　　 D2　↓ Stacks
　　H1　　　D3　↑
　　H2　　　D4　↑
```

This mechanic will resolve when you are either in the middle of the room, or on the left platform later on. 

**Spreads**

### Pandaemoniac Meltdown

Two players are targetted with a beam, the remaining players stack mid for a beam stack.

![243144336-ab91ef89-5176-40a8-9fad-307916b56436.webp](/images/p10s-lasers.webp)

### Pandaemoniac Turrets

The following video does a good job explaining this mechanic in particular (note it does use slightly different strats for other mechs)

@[](https://youtu.be/qwQoAAl9qsM?t=458)

Another set of 8 towers will spawn, these must be soaked as per the macro:
```markdown
■【Pandemoniac Turrets】
　　MT　D1　D2　ST
　　H1　D3　D4　H2　　※ Order: M 》 R 》 H
```
A turret will spawn on each tower, these will fixate the closest target and fire a laser across the room in numbered order.

These must be soaked in pairs, each pair will consist of a Tank and one Melee/Ranged or Healer. The Tank will be second-in-line from the laser, as the first person to get hit will take a vuln.

The Turrets should be soaked in the following order.

1. Melee + Tanks
2. Ranged + Tanks
3. Healers + Tanks
4. Tanks Solo

This will play out something like this
1. 8 Turrets will spawn
2. Melee will bait the first two turrets, tanks stand behind them, others dodge laser.
3. Ranged will baits second two turrets, tanks stand behind them, others dodge laser.
4. Healers will bait third turrets, tanks stand behind them, others dodge laser.
5. Tanks will use heavy mits and take last turrets. Party dodge behind them.

Here is an example of one pattern:

3113
4224

**First Turret** - Melee baits with Tank

![243145118-73dea920-6307-4fe5-a356-b562e84e20a7.webp](/images/p10s-turret1.webp)

**Second Turret** - Ranged baits with Tank

![243145132-6e507041-e7e7-442c-97c8-9c557bd44ee4.webp](/images/p10s-turret2.webp)

**Third Turret** - Healers baits with Tank

![243155732-3ea9e708-18d8-4304-85a1-f076dd8b02f7.webp](/images/p10s-turret3.webp)

**Fourth Turret** - Tanks bait solo

![243155828-d6cd0e88-8811-458b-b5b7-4c87dd749111.webp](/images/p10s-turret4.webp)

### Pandaemoniac Ray
Half room cleave followed by a set of narrow lines along the room. Look for the yellow orbs to dodge lines.

![243145371-303e17e6-94e2-4069-b2ec-384dc9c8a68c.webp](/images/p10s-ray.webp)

### Dividing Wings + Pandaemoniac Web
For an upcoming mechanic, the party will need to build a web at the bottom of the room.

- Two players will get tethers, these should be taken EAST and WEST respectively.
- Three players will get web-AOEs, these should be taken to the south wall touching each other. 
- One player will get an AOE SOAK which should be soaked in a triangle like the first mechanic. 

![243145809-73b3d1d4-1981-4be9-8dd0-7b53bcbdd954.webp](/images/p102s-web2.webp)

After this, break out the Three stacked players, they will then also get three AOEs that need to be lined up on the south wall.

![243145877-3ff447e2-206d-4fe6-81e8-031933793f8c.webp](/images/p10s-webwall.webp)

### Harrowing Hell

::: warning
Extremely heavy raidwide, 8 hits over 12 seconds with 1 more hit 15 seconds after cast. Party will then be knocked back to wall, then immediately position for **Demoiniac Binds**.
:::

### Post Harrowing
After harrowing the mechanics will primarily repeat or re-introduce the mechs from normal until Enrage.
