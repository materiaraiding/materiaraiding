## Save the Queen Overview

**Save the Queen** allows players to progress their character's power in **many different ways**, each serving to help the player in all **Save the Queen**-related Field Operations.

These upgrades are not strictly required to clear the raid, but are generally recommended if you have lots of Gil and/or plan to spend a lot of time in **Save the Queen**-related Field Operations.

### Lost Actions and Essences

Lost Actions, introduced in **The Bozjan Southern Front**, allow the use of **2 specialised actions** at any time that have various, powerful effects.

To obtain and equip them, players must first aquire the necessary **Forgotten Fragments**. These can be dropped by mobs, FATEs and Critical Engagements, found in coffers and also purchased from both the **Resistance Quartermasters** within each Field Operation and the Marketboard. Afterwards, you can speak with a **Resistance Appraiser** to appraise them.

Essences, also introduced in **The Bozjan Southern Front** are a subset of Lost Actions that passively boost certain stats and augment certain Lost Actions, lasting until the player leaves the instance or changes jobs.

There are three categories of Essences:

1. **Essences**
2. **Deep Essences** - Stronger variations of **Essences**, giving higher stat boosts.
3. **Pure Essences** - Unique Essences only available for use within **Delubrum Reginae** and its **Savage** variant.

To see a complete table of Lost Actions, along with their effects and Forgotten Fragment acquisitions, please see the website below:

<Action title='Lost Actions List' color='purple' href='https://ffxiv.kmiwl.de/bozja/' />

### Garlean Synthetic Fabric

Garlean Synthetic Fabric is a unique quest material used to increase the maximum capacity of a player's Lost Actions holster by **10** slots.

To start, players must first accept the quest: **Let Me Holster That for You**, from **Kriv** within **Gangos**, available right before unlocking the next Field Operation, **Zadnor**.

Players must then turn in **3** Garlean Synthetic Fabrics to complete the quest. They are available as rare drops from certain FATEs and Critical Engagements within The **Bozjan Southern Front**, and can also bought off the Marketboard.

### Resistance Honors

Resistance Honors, introduced in **Zadnor**, allow players to exchange any additional mettle earned after achieving **Resistance Rank 25** for permament, passive buffs.

To obtain these, players must speak to the **Resistance Councilor** within **Zadnor**. From here, players can exchange **20 million** mettle for **3 Proofs of Mettle**, which can then be exchanged for three available Resistance Honors:

- **Ray of Fortitude** - Increases max HP (**5%** per stack).
- **Ray of Valor** - Increases damage dealt (**3%** per stack).
- **Ray of Succor** - Increases healing potency (**10%** per stack).

### Augmented Bozjan and Law's Order Sets

Augmented Bozjan and Law's Order sets are obtainable gear that increase the player's **Haste** stat while in **Save the Queen**-related Field Operations, with each point reducing the GCD's cooldown by an **additive 1%**.

Augmented Bozjan Sets are obtainable from the **Resistance Supplier** within **The Bozjan Southern Front**, first by exchanging **Bozjan Coins** for the unaugmented gear, then augmenting it with **Bozjan Runner's Secrets**, obtainable from the Critical Engagement: **The Battle for Castrum Lacus Litore** or purchased with **Bozjan Coins**.

Augmented Law's Order sets are obtainable from the **Resistance Supplier** within **Gangos**, first by exchanging **Bozjan Gold Coins** for the unaugmented gear, then augmenting it with both the **Orderly Runner's Secrets**, obtainable from **Delubrum Reginae (Savage)**, and the Augmented Bozjan gear.

### Bozjan Earring

The Bozjan Earring is another piece of gear that increases the player's **Haste** stat while in **Save the Queen**-related Field Operations.

It is rewarded to players for achieving **Lost and Found IV**, by appraising **1,000 Forgotten Fragments**.

## Raid: Delubrum Reginae (Savage)

::: warning WARNING
This guide will entail set ups and strategies for an **ANYPROG** run, meaning that any player at any prog-point in the raid can join.

Depending on **what** type of run it is and **who** is running it, your assigned roles and Lost Actions in the raid can **change considerably**. Please confirm your role and actions with the raid leader's linked resources, and be sure to ask questions if you are unsure of anything.

### Entry Requirements

**Delubrum Reginae (Savage)** is unlocked and entered by completing the quest: **A Seaside Story** from the **Troubled Gentleman** in **Gangos**. To unlock the quest, players must fulfil the following requirements:

- They have completed the quest: **Fit for a Queen**.
- They are **Resistance Rank 15**.
- They currenlty have **700,000** mettle.

::: tip Finding a Group
Two major communities support Field Operations in OCE, the **Content Achievers** Discord covers a wide variety of content including Field Operations, while the **Murder of Geese (MOG)** Discord focuses specifically on Field Operations Raids and coordinating groups.

<Action title='Content Achievers Discord' color='black' href='https://discord.gg/FJFxr2U' />

<Action title='Murder of Geese (MOG) Discord' color='black' href='https://discord.gg/czkX3cTKuj' />
:::

### Set Up

::: tip NOTE
The nature of **Lost Actions** allows players to take on other roles to cover any missing bases of tanking, healing and damage.

<Action title='Lost Actions List' color='black' href='https://ffxiv.kmiwl.de/bozja/' />
:::

Each party should aim for:

- **x2** Tanks
- **x2** Healers
- **x1** Melee DPS
- **x1** Phys. Ranged DPS
- **x1** Caster DPS
- **x1** Any DPS

Additionally, everyone should have a **Reraise** buff active at **AT ALL TIMES**, available from either a **Resistance Reraiser** or the Lost Action: **Lost Reraise**. It offers you a **70% chance** to be automatically revived if you die, a very useful tool to circumvent the restriction on standard raises. **If it gets consumed**, find a safe moment to refresh your buff, even during battle.

Depending on your role, it's essential to have certain **Pure Essences** active, both to provide stat boosts as well as augment certain Lost Actions that become useful in the raid. These are:

| **Role** | **Pure Essence** | **Augmented Lost Action**
| :- | :-: | :-: |
| ![](/images/tags/tank.webp) **Tank** | Indomitable | **Lost Sacrifice** - Now provides a **50% chance** to avoid the **Sacrifice** debuff. |
| ![](/images/tags/healer.webp) **Healer** | Divine | **Lost Arise** - Now provides a **10% chance** to raise a player despite the restriction on standard raises. |
| ![](/images/tags/melee.webp) **Melee DPS**| Duelist | **Banner of Honored Sacrifice** - Removes the life drain effect and the duration of the buff is increased to **30 seconds**. |
| ![](/images/tags/phys-ranged.webp) **Phys. Ranged DPS** | Fiendhunter | **Lost Cure II** - Grants a large MP regen effect at the cost of a stacking **Slow** debuff. |
| ![](/images/tags/caster.webp) **Caster DPS** | Elder | **Lost Cure IV** - Grants **Lost Bravery** to all targets healed, increasing damage by **10%** for **1 minute**. |

Below are mini-guides and example loadouts for each role within **Delubrum Reginae (Savage)**:
