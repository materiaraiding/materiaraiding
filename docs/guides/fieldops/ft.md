## Forked Tower: Blood Overview

**The Forked Tower: Blood** is the first raid available within **The Occult Crescent**, introduced in **Dawntrail**. The raid features multiple **bosses** and **small-scale encounters**, requiring a large group of players with good coordination to complete. The raid is designed for up to **48** players, but parties may enter with as little as **24** players should they still meet the entry requirements.

Entry to **The Forked Tower: Blood** is located within **The Occult Crescent: South Horn** and will require completing several prerequisites before players can enter the raid.

Read on for more information about **Occult Crescent** or click below to jump to the Raid Guide.

<Action title='Raid Guide' target='_self' color='raid' href='#raid-the-forked-tower-blood' />

## Occult Crescent Overview

**Occult Crescent** allows players to progress their character's power in **several different ways**, each serving to help the player in all **Occult Crescent**-related Field Operations.

These upgrades are not strictly required to clear the raid, but are generally recommended if you plan to spend a lot of time in **Occult Crescent**-related Field Operations.

### Phantom Jobs

**Phantom Jobs** allow players to temporarily take on the unique abilities of various jobs. There are currently **13 Phantom Jobs** available in The Occult Crescent, some are purchased with **Enlightenment Silver and Gold Pieces** while others are dropped from various CEs.

| <span style="font-size: 18px;">**Default**</span> <br /> (Starting jobs) | <span style="font-size: 18px;">**Silver Pieces**</span> <br /> (1000 per job) | <span style="font-size: 18px;">**Gold Pieces**</span> <br /> (1600 per job) | <span style="font-size: 18px;">**CE Drop**</span> <br /> (Listed below, not guaranteed) |

**Phantom Jobs** can level up by earning **Phantom EXP**, earned through FATEs, Critical Encounters (CEs) and Chain bonuses.

Reaching the maximum level on a **Phantom Job** will earn you a stack of ^[Phantom Mastery] **Phantom Mastery**, a permanent buff increasing your damage dealt and healing potency by **~2-2.5%** for each stack, as well as adding **1 level** to your **Phantom Freelancer**.

Demiatma can be obtained from various sources, including:
- Completing CEs in South Horn, at a **20% drop chance**.

<Action title='Full Interactive Map' color='purple' href='https://lynn.pet/map/southhorn' />

Upon completing the one-time quest, you can trade **3 Arcanite**, purchased from **Ermina** for **500 uncapped Tomestones** each, to **Dodokkuli** for a **Phantom Weapon Penumbrae**. Both vendors are located within Phantom Village.

-->

### Arcanaut Sets

Arcanaut Sets are obtainable gear that offer substantial increases in universal offence while in **Occult Crescent**-related Field Operations.

Each gear piece costs **4000 Enlightenment Silver Pieces** and provide the following bonuses:
- **+40** Main Stat (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Mind)
- **+1** Special Attribute

Special Attribute scales up damage from all **Phantom Job abilities** that have "**Scale with item level**" in their tooltip description.

You can upgrade the Arcanaut sets using various upgrade materials obtained around **South Horn**:
- **Aetherspun Silvers** can be purchased for **1200 Enlightenment Silver Pieces** each. **3** are required to augment a single gear piece to +1.
- **Aetherial Fixatives** can be purchased for **1600 Enlightenment Gold Pieces** each. **3** are required to augment a single gear piece to +1.

- **X-Fixatives** can be purchased for **10 Sanguinite** each. **6** are required to augment a single gear piece to +2.

Each augment will add another **+40** Main Stat and **+1** Special Attribute to a gear piece of your choice.

## Raid: The Forked Tower: Blood

::: warning WARNING
This guide will entail Set Ups and strategies for an **ANYPROG** run, meaning that any player at any prog-point in the raid can join.

Depending on **what** type of run it is and **who** is running it, your assigned roles and **Phantom Jobs** in the raid can **change considerably**. Please confirm your role and **Phantom Job** with the raid leader's linked resources, and be sure to ask questions if you are unsure of anything.

### Entry Requirements

Any player who is **Knowledge Level 20** and has completed the **Mysteries Abide** quest can enter **The Forked Tower: Blood**.

To enter **The Forked Tower: Blood**, a minimum of **24** players must have met the above prerequisites to spawn the **Auroral Mirages** weather and begin the entry process.

To successfully complete the entry process, at least **24** players must offer a **Sanguine Cipher**, to the torches found at **Solitary Pavilion**, located at X: 22.7, Y: 21.5. **Sanguine Ciphers** can be purchased from the **Expedition Antiquarian**, located within South Horn's base camp, for **600 Enlightenment Silver Pieces** or **960 Enlightenment Gold Pieces**.

::: warning
Each player looking to enter **The Forked Tower: Blood** must offer at least **1 Sanguine Cipher**, even should you exceed the minimum **24** offerings required to begin the raid.
:::

Should the **entry process fail**, your offerings of **Sanguine Ciphers** will be returned to you. They will only be consumed *if* the entry process succeeds, regardless of if you are not selected for the raid or not.

::: tip Finding a Group
Two major communities support Field Operations in OCE, the **Content Achievers** Discord covers a wide variety of content including Field Operations, while the **Murder of Geese (MOG)** Discord focuses specifically on Field Operations Raids and coordinating groups.

<Action title='Content Achievers Discord' color='black' href='https://discord.gg/FJFxr2U' />

<Action title='Murder of Geese (MOG) Discord' color='black' href='https://discord.gg/czkX3cTKuj' />

### Set Up

::: tip Phantom Jobs
The nature of **Phantom Jobs** may allow players to take on other roles to cover any missing bases of tanking, healing and damage.

<Action title='Detailed Phantom Job Info' color='black' href='https://lynn.pet/occult/phantomjob' />
:::

When players first spawn in, the elevated glowing platform they are standing on will allow them to change both **Job** and **Phantom Job**. Ensure you and your party are on your intended jobs before dropping off the platform.

At a baseline, each party should aim for:

- **x1** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] Tank
- **x1** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Healer] Healer
- **x2** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: DPS] DPS

Each party will also have a **Letter** / **Number designation**, used for mechanic positions. These are:
- **Letter** Alliance
	> - Party **A**
	> - Party **B**
	> - Party **C**

- **Number** Alliance
	> - Party **1** / **D**
	> - Party **2** / **E**
	> - Party **3** / **F**

Additionally, the raid should have the following **Phantom Jobs** to successfully clear the raid:

| <span style="font-size: 18px;">**Phantom Job**</span> | <span style="font-size: 18px;">**Amount**</span> | <span style="font-size: 18px;">**Responsibilities**</span> |

::: tip Additional Information
^[Phantom Chemist] **Phantom Chemists** and ^[Phantom Samurai] **Phantom Samurai** should ensure they have their **consumable** items, **Occult Potions/Elixirs** and **Occult Coffers** respectively, in their inventory. These can be purchased for **Enlightenment Silver/Gold Pieces** and **Gil** in **South Horn's** base camp.

 ^[Phantom Ranger] **Rangers** and ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** should ensure they communicate **clearly** with the team when deciding to pop traps.
:::

Finally, below are in-depth guides for certain **Phantom Jobs** within **The Forked Tower: Blood**. Players can follow these to maximise their **Phantom Job's** effectiveness:

### Encounters

#### Boss 1 - Demon Tablet

**Demon Tablet** is the first boss of **The Forked Tower: Blood**. It features several simple mechanics, but with **harsh punishments** and a **hard enrage** at **6:40**. **Demon Tablet** itself is a **wide enemy**, splitting the room into **two square platforms** and **preventing** players from walking through the boss, **unless** it is raised into the air while casting an attack. Finally, **Demon Tablet's** auto attacks will target the top **three** enmity players.

**Demon Tablet** will begin the fight by using **Demonic Dark II**, a very heavy hitting raidwide.

Throughout the fight, **Demon Tablet** will combine its primary attacks with **one** of **two** late-telegraphed attacks. To understand which attack the boss will use, players can read the **suffix** of the castbar. These are:
- **[Attack] of Dangers Near** - PB-AoE. Players should be about half a platform's length away from the boss.
- **[Attack] of Expulsion Afar** - **Linear knockback** originating from the boss. Players should be close to the middle, but not directly under the boss.

After the raidwide, **Demon Tablet** will cast **Ray of Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar**, which will fire persistent AoE lasers down one half of the arena. Players can determine which half will be unsafe by the presence of **three large glowing orbs** that spawn in front of **Demon Tablet**. While casting this, the boss will raise into the air, allowing players to cross through to the safe side. Players should also make sure to position for the **Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar** as they cross through. This is cast one more time before moving on.

**Demon Tablet** will then target the top **three** enmity players for **Occult Chisel**, an AoE tankbuster. ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** should break away from the raid to ensure no one else gets hit, and are free to stack on top of each other provided they use their job's ^[Hallowed Ground] ^[Holmgang] ^[Living Dead] ^[Superbolide] **Invulnerability**.

##### Demonograph

**Demon Tablet** will cast **Demonograph of Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar**, raising into the air and creating **three** tower AoEs on each side. At least **four** players must be within a tower to successfully soak the damage. If not, the tower will explode, dealing heavy raidwide damage and applying a stack of ^[Thrice-come Ruin] **Thrice-come Ruin**.

To resolve this, the raid will split into their individual parties, using their assigned waymark to find their tower:
- **A/1** - Front **left** (facing the boss).
- **B/2** - Back **middle**.
- **C/3** - Front **right** (facing the boss).

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss1towers.webp)

::: warning Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar
Make sure to dodge the **Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar** portion of the attack **BEFORE** positioning to soak your tower.
:::

After the towers resolve, **Demon Tablet** will cast **Rotate Left/Right**, rotating its body **90°** and **knocking away** any players caught within its axis of rotation. Looking towards the boss, players should move in the **opposite direction** of the castbar.

**Demon Tablet** will cast **Rotate Left/Right** again, while it's rotated **90°**. Players should follow the same logic as before, but also ensure they are on the backside of the boss before it rotates. Anyone in front of the Boss after its second rotation will be hit by a persistent AoE.

##### Cometeor

**Demon Tablet** will begin casting **Cometeor of Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar**, raising into the air and targeting random players with markers. These markers are:

- **Four Stack markers**, with trajectory indicators. **2** will be pointing **North** and **2** will be pointing **South**.
- ^[Crater Later] **Eight Meteor markers**, which place a massive telegraphed AoE at the player's location when the ^[Crater Later] **debuff** expires.
- **One fixed Meteor marker** at the very **North** or **South** edge of the arena.

This mechanic is resolved in **two** parts. First, all marked players must move to the **correct** side of the arena:

- **Stack** players should move to the side that makes their trajectory arrow point towards **Demon Tablet**.
- ^[Crater Later] **Meteor** players should move to the side with the **fixed Meteor** marker.
- **Unmarked** players should move to the side without the **fixed Meteor** marker.

::: warning Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar
Make sure to dodge the **Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar** portion of the attack **BEFORE** resolving the next part of the mechanic.
:::

After the cast resolves, players should get ready to resolve their mechanic:
- **Stack** players on the **non-fixed Meteor** side should stand along the **back wall**, to get sent along their half.
- **Stack** players on the **fixed Meteor** side should stand **close** to the boss, to get sent over to the safe half.
- ^[Crater Later] **Meteor** players should stand at the **back wall** of their half, letting their AoEs appear **before** joining the **Stack** players on their side.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss1meteors.webp)

After the AoEs resolve, **Demon Tablet** will cast **Rotate Left/Right** again twice. Players should follow the same logic as before.

**Demon Tablet** will then cast **Summon**, raising into the air, creating a telegraphed AoE under itself and summoning **two Summoned Demons** and **one Summoned Arch Demon** on each side. Each party can use the same designation as the [**Demonograph**](#demonograph) towers to find their add.

::: tip Time Mages
Each **Summoned Arch Demon** will spawn with a ^[Dark Defenses] **defence increasing buff**. ^[Phantom Time Mage] **Time Mages** will need to remove this buff with **Occult Dispel**.
:::

##### Gravity

**Demon Tablet** will cast **Summon** again, this time summoning **two Gargoyle Statues** on each side. Later on, these will be levitated and then dropped, creating a large circular AoE at the impact point and leaving **one** corner of each side safe.

**Demon Tablet** will also cast **Demonography** again, this time creating **six** towers on one side of the arena. **three** of these towers will be levitated up.

Finally, **Demon Tablet** will cast **Gravity of Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar**, levitating the statues and any players standing beside them shortly after the cast finishes. Players can use the same **Colour** designation as their [**Demonograph**](#demonograph) towers to find which tower they will soak. However, since all the towers are on one side, all players **crossing over** should also stand next to the statues to levitate up. Players should make sure to position for the **Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar** as they position themselves.

::: warning Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar
Make sure to dodge the **Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar** portion of the attack **BEFORE** positioning next to the **Gargoyle**.
:::

After the statues and all nearby players have been levitated, everyone should stand in their tower, then finally stand at the safe corner left by the dropping **Gargoyle Statues**.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss1gravity.webp)

There are no new mechanics from this point onwards. **Demon Tablet** will use the following sequence of attacks, before casting a **hard enrage** at **6:40**:

1. **Rotate Left/Right**
2. **Rotate Left/Right**
3. **Cometeor of Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar**
4. **Ray of Dangers Near/Expulsion Afar**
5. **Occult Chisel**
6. **Demonic Dark II**

#### Hallways

The **Hallways** are the first set of trash encounters in **The Forked Tower: Blood**. It features **optional loot**, only obtainable with a ^[Phantom Thief] **Phantom Thief** and multiple **hidden traps** sprinkled throughout.

There are **two** types of **hidden traps**, both of which are can only be uncovered with ^[Phantom Thief] **Phantom Thief's Trap Detection**, and both of which are **walked around**, unless a ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tank** ^[Phantom Ranger] or **Phantom Ranger** has **communicated** about popping them.

| <span style="font-size: 18px;">**Normal Trap**</span> | <span style="font-size: 18px;">**Mega Trap**</span> |

| **Explodes** in a **small area** around itself when detonated, killing any nearby players. | **Explodes** in a **massive area** around itself when detonated, killing any surrounding players. |

There is also a **roaming trap** that looks like a **green orb**, floating along the walls of the **Hallways**. Players that step inside are afflicted with ^[Silence] **Silence** for **one minute**.

**Lightning floors** appear throughout the **Hallways**, connected to an **orb** that when interacted with, will disable the trap. Anyone that steps on the floor while active will be afflicted with an instakill ^[Electrocution] **bleed debuff**. These require a ^[Phantom Geomancer] **Phantom Geomancer** to use ^[Suspend] **Suspend** on either themselves or a party member, negating the effects of the **lightning floors** on the chosen player.

::: tip Lightning Floors
^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** can also use their ^[Hallowed Ground] ^[Holmgang] ^[Living Dead] ^[Superbolide] **Invulnerability** to ignore the ^[Electrocution] **bleed debuff**, giving them enough time to interact with the **orb** and disable the trap.

This is only viable for the **lightning floors** in the **Hallways**.
:::

Finally, almost all trash mobs can be ^[Slow] **Slowed** by ^[Phantom Time Mage] **Phantom Time Mages** and instakilled by ^[Phantom Samurai] **Phantom Samurai**, ^[Phantom Cannoneer] **Phantom Cannoneers** and ^[Phantom Oracle] **Phantom Oracles**.

Below is a table noting some mobs and their **dangerous casts**, a table detailing which mobs are susceptible to which statuses and a detailed map of the **Hallways** themselves, including traps and hidden rooms only discoverable though the ^[Phantom Thief] **Phantom Thief's Trap Detection**.

| **Enemy** | **Attack** |
| :-: | :-: |
| **Tower Manticore** | **Left/Right Hammer** - Late-telegraphed cleave AoE depending on the castbar, will hit the opposite side shortly after. |
| **Tower Scarab** | **Rhino Guard** - Grants itself an ^[Evasion Up] **evasion buff**. ^[Phantom Time Mage] **Phantom Time Mages** must use **Occult Dispel**. |

#### Boss 2 - Dead Stars

**The Dead Stars** can be considered the first wall of the raid, with mechanics that can easily wipe the party from **1** player's mistakes. It has a **hard enrage** at **7:00**.

To start, all players should **group** the trio of bosses in the middle. To deal as much **cleave damage** as possible before they split up for the rest of the fight.

When they do split up, each boss will cast **Decisive Battle**, a PB-AoE that also inflicts each surrounding player with ^[Phobosic Gravity] **Phobosic / ^[Tritonic Gravity] Tritonic / ^[Nereidic Gravity] Nereidic Gravity**, ensuring they can't hit any other boss. To evenly split up the raid, each party will target the following:
- **A/1** - **Phobos** (Green) ^[Phobosic Gravity]
- **B/2** - **Triton** (Red) ^[Tritonic Gravity]
- **C/3** - **Nereid** (Blue) ^[Nereidic Gravity]

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss2targets.webp)

::: tip Tethers
Sometimes players may be **tethered** to entirely different bosses from those they're attacking, including the current ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Main Tanks**. Ensure that the upcoming **conal tankbusters** are resolved before changing targets.
:::

Shortly after, each boss will also cast **Slice 'N' Dice** a **conal tankbuster** on the top emnity player.

Each boss will then **jump** towards each other, casting **Three Body Problem**. Each time this happens, one of the **Dead Stars** will interrupt the cast, jump into the middle, and transform the other two bosses, beginning a **mini-phase**.

After each **mini-phase**, the transformed bosses will jump to an edge of the arena, targeting the traitorous **Dead Star** with **Vengeful Fire/Blizzard/Bio III**. These are **wide conal AoEs** only leaving a safespot in between the **2** previously transformed **Dead Stars**.

They will then **tether** to each player again and return to their area, each casting **Delta Attack**, a repeated heavy raidwide, followed by **Fire Strikes**, a line stack AoE that also inflicts players with a ^[Magic Vulnerability Up] **Magic Vulnerability**. After [**Snowballs**](#snowballs), this is also combined with a **Slice 'N' Dice**.

##### Slimes

<Action title='Slimes - Pocket Guide' color='black'  href='https://youtu.be/kvyuk_0zt2o'/>

**Phobos** transformes the other **2 Dead Stars** into **untargetable** slimes.

**Phobos** begins with **Primordial Chaos**, a raidwide that inflicts every player with **one-three stacks** of either ^[Nova Ooze] **Nova Ooze** or ^[Ice Ooze] **Ice Ooze**. Players will need to remove their debuff before the end of the **mini-phase** or they will immediately die.

Phobos will then begin casting **Frozen Fallout**, commanding the slimes to jump around the arena **four** times. To remove a stack of ^[Nova Ooze] ^[Ice Ooze] **Ooze**, players must be hit by a jump of the opposite element. Once players have removed their stacks, they should instead look towards dodging **both** slimes. During the cast, players should **sequentially** keep track of which spots will be hit by a jump they want and which spots will be safe after removing their stacks.

After the fourth jump, Phobos will cast **Noxious Nova**, a light raidwide that will **instakill** any players with any remaining ^[Nova Ooze] ^[Ice Ooze] **Ooze stacks**. This will also transform **Triton** and **Nereid** back into their original selves.

##### Snowballs

**Nereid** transforms the other **two Dead Stars** into **targetable** snowballs. Each snowball has **four stacks** of ^[Icebound Buffoonery] **Icebound Buffoonery**, an **invinciblilty buff** that must be removed to destroy the snowballs before their **hard enrage** at the end of the **mini-phase**.

**Nereid** begins with **Snowball Fight**, commanding the snowballs to charge **three times** around the arena. Each charge is a **Wild Charge**, a line stack AoE that deals additional damage to the player closest to the enemy. Each charge also inflicts a ^[Physical Vulnerability Up] **Physical Vulnerability**, preventing players from taking additional **Wild Charges**. At least **four players** need to be in a single **Wild Charge** to remove a stack of ^[Icebound Buffoonery] **Icebound Buffoonery** from the snowball.

To resolve this, each party is designated to soak a certain **Wild Charge** from the snowballs:
- The **North** snowball's **Wild Charges** will be soaked by **A** -> **B** -> **C**, in that order.
- The **Southwest** snowball's **Wild Charges** will be soaked by **1** -> **2** -> **3**, in that order.

::: tip Wild Charges
^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** should ensure they are at the **front** of the **Wild Charges** ready to bear the brunt of the damage.

^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks**, ^[Phantom Knight] **Phantom Knights** and ^[Phantom Samurai] **Phantom Samurai** can ignore the ^[Physical Vulnerability Up] **Physical Vulnerability** and use their ^[Hallowed Ground] ^[Holmgang] ^[Living Dead] ^[Superbolide] **Invulnerability**, ^[Pledge] **Pledge** and **Shirahadori** respectively to soak another **Wild Charge**.
:::

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss2snowballs1.webp)

After the **3** charges, **Nereid** will begin casting **Chilling Collision**, a knockback originating from itself, while the snowballs will tether to a random player and cast **Avalaunch**, a **proximity Stack AoE** that will also remove a stack of its ^[Icebound Buffoonery] **Icebound Buffoonery** should enough players share the damage. **Everyone** should stand on **Nereid's** hitbox, with **tethered** players standing on the opposite side of their **tethered** snowballs, and **non-tethered** players standing on the opposite side of the snowball they soaked previously. After the **knockback**, all players should stack at the wall.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss2snowballs2.webp)

If done **correctly**, the snowballs will lose all stacks of their ^[Icebound Buffoonery] **Icebound Buffoonery**, and players can destroy them before they finish casting their **hard enrage**, freeing **Phobos** and **Triton**.

##### Fireballs

**Triton** transforms the other **two Dead Stars** into fireballs which jump away.

After the fireballs jump away, **two sets of arrows** will appear in the arena, opposite of each other. They will travel a short distance counterclockwise before casting **Elemental Impact three times** becoming targetable upon the first cast. Eventually, they will cast a **hard enrage**, requiring players to destroy the fireballs before this happens.

To ensure even numbers for each fireball. The raid will split into **two**, with the **Letter** Alliance looking for arrows in the **Northern Half** of the arena, and the **Number** Alliance looking for arrows in the **Southern Half** of the arena.

::: tip Arrows
In one particular pattern, the arrows can spawn **Northwest** and **Southeast** and "**cross**" into the other half of the arena. Players should still follow the arrow **beginning** in their half.
:::

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss2fireballs1.webp)

**Elemental Impact** is comprised of **two components**:
- A tankbuster tower that must be soaked, inflicts a ^[Magic Vulnerability Up] **Magic Vulnerability** each hit.
- **Two wide conal AoEs**, each targeting a random ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Healer] **Healer** and ^[Aetheric Mimicry: DPS] **DPS**, inflicts a ^[Magic Vulnerability Up] **Magic Vulnerability** each hit.

To resolve this, each fireball should have:
- ^[Aetheric Mimicry: DPS] **DPS** standing along the **wall**
- ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Healer] **Healers** standing to the **side** of the fireballs
- **One ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] Tank** soaking all **3 hits** with an ^[Hallowed Ground] ^[Holmgang] ^[Living Dead] ^[Superbolide] ^[Pledge] **Invulnerability**, using the same order they used to soak the snowballs' **Wild Charges**.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss2fireballs2.webp)

After **Elemental Impact** casts **3 times**, the fireballs will target random players for a large baited AoE while **Triton** besgins casting **Flame Thrower** a **Line Stack AoE** targeting a player on each side. To ensure all players are grouped up for the **stack** while minimising movement, all players will stack with the ^[Aetheric Mimicry: DPS] **DPS** at the wall after the **third hit**, and travel around the fireball **clockwise**.

The cycle will repeat once again before the fireballs begin casting a **hard enrage**.

##### Enrage

After all **3 mini-phases** the **Dead Stars** will cast **Six-Handed Fistfight**, dealing raidwide damage, creating a **persistent circular AoE** in the middle and using the following cycle of mechanics **twice** before **hard enraging**:
1. **Collateral Damage** - **Telegraphed conal AoEs** targeting **three slices** of the arena, then the other **3**.
2. **Spread AoEs** - **Untelegraphed spread AoEs**, hitting **several** random players at a time.

Each **slice** of the arena is assigned to a party, as shown in the image below.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss2enrage.webp)

#### Bridges

The **Bridges** are the second set of trash encounters in **The Forked Tower: Blood**. Similar to the **Hallways**, the **Bridges** feature hidden traps, lightning floors, and **dangerous adds** that must be handled in certain ways.

The **Bridges** are divided into **five waves**, each with a collection of enemies with the potential to wipe the raid should they be given the chance.

| **Wave** | **Attack** |
| :-: | :-: |
| **Wave 1 & 4 - Tower Bhoot** | **Paralyze III** - ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** and **D3** must **interrupt**. |
| **Wave 2 - Tower Abyss** | **Dense Darkness** - Grants itself an **Magic Damage Up buff**. ^[Phantom Time Mage] **Phantom Time Mages** must use **Occult Dispel**. <br> **Diffuse Darkness** - Heavy raidwide. |
| **Wave 3 - Tower Idol x6** | **Ancient Aero III** - **Enrage**. ^[Phantom Bard] **Phantom Bards** must use ^[Arcane Stop] **Romeo's Ballad** when all **six** are casting. |
| **Wave 5 - Tower Progenitor/Progenitrix** | **Close/Far Call to Detonate** - **Drag them Far/Close** from each other respectively, else repeated heavy raidwides. <br> **Bombshell Drop** - Spawns tethered **Lava Bombs** that move towards the enemy, heavy raidwide if they make contact. <br> **Targeted Stack AoE** - Stack. <br> **Massive Explosion** - **Enrage** cast that starts as soon as one dies. Keep them at **similar HP**. |

When the **first** set of adds are pulled, a floor of fire will slowly chase the raid. Players standing in these recieve a **non-lethal ^[Burns] bleed debuff**.

While dealing with these enemies, each side of the bridge will glow with **four line AoEs**. These are **Wild Charges** that inflict the **first player hit** with a ^[Piercing Resistance Down II] **piercing vulnerability**.

::: tip Wild Charges
^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** should ensure they are at the **front** of the **Wild Charges** ready to bear the brunt of the damage.

^[Phantom Samurai] **Phantom Samurai** can ignore the ^[Piercing Resistance Down II] **piercing vulnerability** and use their **Shirahadori** to soak the **Wild Charge**.
:::

#### Boss 3 - Marble Dragon

**Marble Dragon** focuses primarily on dodging, but can still very easily punish players that are slow on movement. It has a **hard enrage** at **6:30**.

**Marble Dragon** begins with **Imitation Star**, a heavy raidwide that inflicts a ^[Bleeding] **bleed**.

**Marble Dragon** then faces towards a random player and begins casting **Draconiform Motion**, an **untelegraphed front and back conal cleave**. Players must move to its **sides** to dodge the attack. The boss will combine this attack with future mechanics to punish early movers. To resolve each instance of this, players should always stack **North** and **South** if they aren't required to move.

**Imitation Rain** is a light raidwide that creates multiple puddles within the arena. Each puddle has **three** variations:
- **Flat** - Will detonate in a large **PB-AoE** shortly after freezing, freezing other nearby puddles.
- **Spiked** - Will detonate in a **plus AoE** shortly after freezing, freezing other nearby puddles.
- **Tower** - Will detonate in a **stack AoE** when frozen. At least **4 players** must be in the tower or it will detonate for a heavy ^[Sustained Damage] **bleed**, scaling with the amount of players missing.

For the first pattern, they will appear with **Flat** and **Spiked** puddles in a horizontal line **North** and **South**.

**Imitation Icicle** will create **two "white" AoEs** on the floor, when they detonate, they will freeze the nearby puddles. Players must first bait a **Draconiform Motion**, before moving to the wall with the **"white" AoE** closer to it. Once players are at the wall, they can dodge the exploding puddles safely, by crossing from one side of the waymark to the other.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss3puddles.webp)

Afterwards, the boss will target the **six highest emnity targets** for **Dread Deluge**, a heavy tankbuster that also inflicts a **heavy ^[Dropsy] bleed**.

::: tip Bleed Tankbusters
The damage the ^[Dropsy] **bleed** takes **mitigation** into account when applied. The **more** mitigation used, the **less** the ^[Dropsy] **bleed** will hurt.
:::

##### Frigid Twister

**Marble Dragon** will use **Imitation Rain** again, creating more puddles in a hexagon pattern, and cast **Frigid Twister**, spawning **two Frigid Twisters** on the **East** and West** of the arena. These **Frigid Twisters** will travel around the arena either **clockwise** or **counter-clockwise**, freezing any puddles it comes across.

Finally, **Marble Dragon** will jump to the middle and begin casting **Draconiform Motion**.

There are **two** potential patterns, depending on which puddles the **Frigid Twisters** freeze first. Dodge the **Draconiform Motion**, then:

- **Spiked First**
	1. Stay under the Boss's hitbox or move to a waymark at the wall.
	2. Move to the corner where the **Spiked Puddles** detonated.

- **Flat First**
	1. Move to the **Spiked Puddles** in the corner.
	2. Move to the waymark at the wall when the middle **Spiked Puddle** detonates.

After any of these patterns, players should ensure they move out of the way of the **Frigid Twisters** approaching them.

Afterwards, **Marble Dragon** will follow up with another **Dread Deluge**.

##### Adds

**Marble Dragon** will jump back to the middle and begin casting **Withering Eternity**, leaving the arena when the cast finishes and summoning **six Ice Golems**. These **Ice Golems** gain a ^[Vulnerability Down] **Vulnerability Down buff** when in close proximity of each other, and will cast **Frozen Heart** if not defeated in time, granting themselves a ^[Physical Damage Up] **Physical Damage Up buff** that will instantlly kill anyone they auto attack. **One ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] tank** from each party should grab an **Ice Golem** and drag it towards their party's closest wall, keeping them separated, even while dodging **Marble Dragon** and using their ^[Hallowed Ground] ^[Holmgang] ^[Living Dead] ^[Superbolide] ^[Pledge] **Invulnerability** if the **Ice Golems** cast **Frozen Heart**. Additionally, **Letter** Alliance players should burst down the **North Ice Golem** and **Number** Alliance players should burst down the **South Ice Golem**

Additionally, **Marble Dragon** will use the following cycle of attacks **twice** before returning:
1. **Imitation Rain** - Spawning **one Spiked Puddle** in the middle and **three Tower Puddles** along the wall, opposite each other.
2. **Frigid Dive** - The boss will dive through the middle of the arena, freezing the **Spiked Puddle** and **two Tower Puddles**.
3. **Two Tower & Spiked Puddles** - The **two Tower & Spiked Puddles** will detonate, freezing the other **four Tower Puddles**.
4. **Four Tower Puddles** - The remaining **four Tower Puddles** will detonate.

To ensure even numbers for each tower. The raid will split into **two**, with the **Letter** Alliance looking for towers in the **Northern Half** of the arena, and the **Number** Alliance looking for towers in the **Southern Half** of the arena. 

Upon returning, **Marble Dragon** will summon **six Tethered Ice Sprites** that tether and travel towards the boss, rendering itself ^[Invincibility] **invincible** while it casts **Withering Eternity**, an incredibly heavy raidwaide. Players must defeat the **Ice Sprites** before they reach **Marble Dragon**, they are susceptible to ^[Phantom Bard] **Bard's Romeo's Ballad** and ^[Phantom Oracle] **Oracle's Cleansing**.

To resolve the entirety of the **Adds** phase, parties will resolve their **Ice Golems**, **Towers** and **Ice Sprites** within their designated area along the wall. **Parties A**, **C**, **1** and **3** should be mindful that any **Tower Puddles** at their closest **East** and **West** respectively becomes their priority to fill.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss3adds.webp)

After **Withering Eternity**, **Marble Dragon** will repeat the **Imitation Rain** sequence shown at the start of the fight, only this time marking some players with ^[Throttle] **Throttle**, a **debuff** that will instantly kill them if not cleansed, and ^[Wicked Water] **Wicked Water**, a **debuff** that traps them within a **Gelid Gaol** when hit by a detonating **puddle**. Players can cleanse the ^[Throttle] **Throttle** by being hit and frozen by a detonating **puddle**, and then being broken out by other players destroying the **Gelid Gaols** imprisoning them.

**Marble Dragon** will then cast **Imitation Star** again.

##### Frigid Twister 2

Similar to [**Frigid Twister**](#frigid-twister), **Marble Dragon** will use **Imitation Rain**, this time spawning **two Flat Puddles** on **two opposite cardinals**, **two Spiked Puddles** on the other **two opposite cardinals** and finally **six Tower Puddles** in either a **horizontal** or **vertical** rectangle in the middle. The boss will also cast **Frigid Twister**, then jump to the middle again and begin casting **Draconiform Motion**.

To resolve the **Tower Puddles**, **Parties A**, **C**, **1** and **3** have fixed positions, and will always soak the corner towers. **Parties B** and **2** will flex, soaking any **North/East** towers and **South/West** towers **respectively**.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss3towers.webp)

Players will need to dodge the first set of detonating **puddles**, then soak their towers, then dodge the second set of detonating **puddles**.

The cycle of **Draconiform Motion** -> **Detonate** -> **Tower** -> **Detonate** will repeat again. After dodging the second set, be sure to remain where you dodged until **Marble Dragon** begins casting **Draconiform Motion** again.

**Marble Dragon** will finally cast **Imitation Star** and **Dread Deluge**, before entering it's **hard enrage** cast at **6:30**.

#### Lockwards

Like the **Hallways** and the **Bridges**, **Lockwards** combines hidden traps and somewhat deadly trash with a small puzzle segment players can choose to solve correctly or skip. ^[Phantom Time Mage] **Phantom Time Mages** should remember to slow any enemies here.

| **Enemy** | **Attack** |
| :-: | :- |
| **Guardian Wraith** | **Scream** - Huge **untelegraphed PB-AoE**, inflicts anyone hit with ^[Terror] **Terror**. |
| **Guardian Berserker** | ^[Vulnerability Down] **Vulnerability Down** - Can only be defeated through **instakill** actions like ^[Phantom Oracle] **Phantom Oracle's Phantom Doom**, ^[Phantom Samurai] **Phantom Samurai's Iainuki** and ^[Phantom Cannoneer] **Phantom Cannonner's Phantom Fire**. |
| **Guardian Golem** | ^[Toxic Minerals] Inflicts **Toxic Minerals** to nearby players, becoming a **cleansable ^[Doom] Doom** when the debuff expires. |
| **Guardian Knight** | ^[Invincibility] **Invincibility** - Can be dispelled by ^[Phantom Time Mage] **Time Mage's Occult Dispel**. <br> **Buster Knuckles** - **Telegraphed PB-AoE** followed by a **late-telegraphed Donut AoE** refreshing ^[Invincibility] **Invincibility**. <br> **Line of Fire** - **Untelegraphed Line AoE** in the direction it's facing. |
| **Guardian Bats** | ^[Evasion Up] **Evasion** - Have **innate ^[Evasion Up] evasion**, can be ignored with ^[Phantom Samurai] **Phantom Samurai's Zeninage**, ^[Phantom Ranger] **Phantom Ranger's Phantom Aim** and **Limit Break**.
| **Guardian Weapon** | ^[Armed to the Teeth] **Armed to the Teeth** - Massive damage buff, must be removed by ^[Phantom Thief] **Phantom Thief's Pilfer Weapon**. |
| **Master Lockward** | **Untelegraphed Raidwide** - Uses at **low health**. Use mitigation. |

The general order of interrupts for the **Lockwards** themselves is:
1. **Letter** Alliance **MTs**
2. **Letter** Alliance **OTs/D3s**
3. **Number** Alliance **MTs**
4. **Number** Alliance **OTs/D3s**

If choosing to do the puzzle correctly, a **Sanguine Recluse** will spawn somewhere in South Horn, the location divulged only to players within the tower. The **Sanguine Recluse** cycles through the following attacks:
1. **Tartarean Flame** - A **telegraphed Donut AoE**.
2. **Tartarean Thunder** - A ** large telegraphed PB-AoE**.
3. **Cryptcall** - A **fast telegraphed frontal cone AoE**, inflicts a **cleansable ^[Doom] Doom** to anyone hit.

Defeating the **Sangune Recluse** will provide all players that participated in killing it **two Sanguinite**. Players inside the raid will recieve an additional **five Sanguinite** after **Magitaur**.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-lockwardsmap.webp)

#### Boss 4 - Magitaur

**Magitaur** is the final boss of **The Forked Tower: Blood**. It features several mechanics that can quickly wipe the raid, and a hard enrage at **8:00**.

**Magitaur** will begin the fight with **Unsealed Aura**, a raidwide. While casting this, players should move to their designated square where they will be resolving most mechanics, shown below.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss4squares.webp)

The boss will then use ^[Unsealed] **Unseal**, creating a **glow** around one of its held weapons and **augmenting** its auto attacks until a future mechanic. **All players** should keep an eye on which weapon is glowing:

- **Axe (Yellow)** - Tankbuster auto attacks on the **two closest targets** in each square. **Yellow Conduits** will augment its next **Aura Burst**.
- **Lance (Blue)** - Tankbuster auto attacks on the **two furthest targets** in each sqaure. **Blue Conduits** will augment its next **Holy**.

^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** should move **close** or **far** accordingly to bait the auto attacks. Everyone else should remain on the boss's hitbox.

##### Assassin's Dagger

<Action title= "Assassin's Dagger - Pocket Guide" color='black'  href='https://youtu.be/iZgTBbww1qo'/>

**Magitaur** will begin casting **Assassin's Dagger**, sending out **three telegraphed line AoEs** that hit the same location twice before rotating. While this mechanic has no "correct" resolve besides dodging the attacks, most raid groups will use **BAP Waymarks**, waymarks specially designed to **minimise the movement** required for this mechanic. Players can simply stand on an appropriate waymark "next to the AoE" while the daggers rotate, until the **following attack** requires them to move:

| **Critical Axeblow** | **Critical Lanceblow** |
| :-: | :-: |
| A **large untelegraphed PB-AoE**, hitting **near the boss** as well as any area that **isn't a square**. <br> The safe spot is at the **far corner of a square**. | An **untelegraphed Donut AoE**, hitting **around the boss** as well as any area that **is a square**. <br> The safe spot is **close to the boss, in between the squares**.
| ![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss4axeblow.webp) | ![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss4lanceblow.webp) |

Players will need to **read the castbar** and navigate to the correct spot, while staying mindful of the daggers still rotating around the arena. The daggers will stop rotating when the second cast of **Critical Axeblow/Lanceblow** finishes.

**Magitaur** will then cast **Forked Fury**, a tankbuster targeting the **closest** and **furthest** player in each square. **Letter** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** will bait the **close** hit, while **Number** ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** will bait the **far** hit.

After **Forked Fury**, **Magitaur** will then use **two more auto attacks**, ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** should position to soak these again.

**Magitaur** will then begin casting **Aura Burst/Holy**, a heavy raidwide that becomes augmented by certain surrounding **Conduits**. Depending on which weapon was augmented, players will want to destroy **Axe Empowerment Conduits (Yellow)**, if the **Axe** was augmented or **Lance Empowerment Conduits (Blue)** if the **Lance** was augmented. When these **Conduits** are destroyed, they will target the **two closest players** for unbelievably high damage. ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** should stand under the **Conduits**, ready to press an ^[Hallowed Ground] ^[Holmgang] ^[Living Dead] ^[Superbolide] ^[Pledge]**Invulnerability** or ^[Phantom Guard] **Phantom Guard** before the **Conduits** are destroyed.

Additionally, **one Universal Empowerment Conduit (Purple)** will appear. When this **Conduit** is destroyed, it will fire a **line AoE** at the **closest target**, inflicting anyone hit with ^[Hysteria] **Hysteria**, forcing them in random directions until the **debuff** falls off or they die. A ^[Phantom Berserker] **Phantom Berserker** will need to place themselves between the **Conduit** and the wall and use ^[Rage] **Rage**, destroying the **Conduit** and negating the **Hysteria ^[Hysteria] debuff**.

If all relevant **Conduits** are destroyed, **Aura Burst/Holy** will only deal heavy raidwide damage and **will not** wipe the raid.

##### Sage's Staff

**Magitaur** will cast **Sage's Staff**, spawning **three Staffs** in the arena. These **Staffs** will target the **closest player** for a **line stack AoE**. Before the **Staffs** resolve, the boss will use **Critical Axeblow/Lanceblow**. Players must dodge the **Axeblow/Lanceblow**, then huddle up in the very **middle** of the arena to share the damage. **Magitaur** uses this cycle of attacks **once again** before ending with an **Unsealed Aura** and moving on.

![](/images/fieldops/ft-boss4sagestaff.webp)

##### Rune Axe

<Action title= "Rune Axe - Pocket Guide" color='black'  href='https://youtu.be/T2hXow9pvWI'/>

**Magitaur** will begin this set of mechanics by first casting **Unseal**. This ^[Unsealed] **Unseal** is guaranteed to augment the **Axe**, so ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** should prepare by standing **close** to the boss in their sqaure. **Magitaur** will then auto attack **three times** before casting **Rune Axe**. Players should **stay in their home square** until the cast finishes.

**Rune Axe** will randomly inflict a certain amoumt of players in **each square** with the following debuffs:

| **Party** | **10s** | **13s** | **21s** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **A**/**1** | **Prey: Greater Axebit** ^[Prey: Greater Axebit] | **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] | **Prey: Greater Axebit** ^[Prey: Greater Axebit] |
| **B**/**2** |  | **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] | **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] |
| **C**/**3** |  | **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] | **Prey: Lesser Axebit** ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] |

When any of these debuffs expire, a **targeted AoE** around the player will detonate, also inflicting damage and a stack of ^[Thrice-come Ruin] **Thrice-come Ruin** to any players standing in the **flooring** the **AoE** touched. To resolve these sequences of **debuffs** expiring. We do the following for each set of debuffs:

- ^[Prey: Greater Axebit] **Prey: Greater Axebit** players should stand at the **very wall of the arena**, next to a **Purple Conduit**, ensureing they don't overlap their **AoE** with any **Square Flooring**.
- ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] **Prey: Lesser Axebit** players should stand in the **very middle of their square**, ensuring they don't overlap their **AoE** with the **Non-Square Flooring**.

Before the **13s** set of ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] **Prey: Lesser Axebit** resolve, **Magitaur** will cast **Critical Lanceblow**. ^[Prey: Lesser Axebit] **Prey: Lesser Axebit** players should ensure they **let their debuff expire FIRST**, before moving into the safe zone.

During the **21s** set of debuffs, the **Northwest A/1 Square** will be safe for unmarked players to dodge into. **Magitaur** will also periodically target random players for **moderate damage**.

After all debuffs have resolved, **all players** should return to their square. **Magitaur** will cast **Forked Fury**, followed by **two Augmented auto attacks** and finally **Aura Burst** again. Players must destroy the **Yellow and **Purple Conduits** to prevent a raid wipe.

**Magitaur** will then use the [**Assassin's Dagger**](#assassin-s-dagger) sequence again, with no changes to how the mechanic is solved.

##### Holy Lance

<Action title= "Holy Lance - Pocket Guide" color='black'  href='https://youtu.be/TQuON4f6OBA'/>

**Magitaur** will begin this set of mechanics by first casting **Unseal**. This ^[Unsealed] **Unseal** is guaranteed to augment the **Lance**, so ^[Aetheric Mimicry: Tank] **Tanks** should prepare by standing **far** from the boss in their sqaure. **Magitaur** will then auto attack **three times** before casting **Holy Lance**. Players should **stay in their home square** until the cast finishes.

**Holy Lance** will randomly inflict **three players in each sqaure** with ^[Prey: Lancepoint] **Prey: Lancepoint**. When ^[Prey: Lancepoint] **Prey: Lancepoint** expires, a **Targeted Stack AoE** around the player will detonate, also inflicting damage and a stack of ^[Thrice-come Ruin] **Thrice-come Ruin** to any players standing outside of a **stack**. Players in the stack will instead be inflicted with a ^[Magic Vulnerability Up] **Magic Vulnerability**.

Additionally, **twelve Lances** will fall into the arena, starting **North** on the **Non-Square Flooring** and rotating **clockwise**. These **Lances** will detonate in the same order they dropped, inflicting a ^[Thrice-come Ruin] **Thrice-Come Ruin** to any players standing in the same tile when it detonates.

As the **Lances** drop, **Magitaur** will cast **Critical Lancebow**.

To resolve these sequences of debuffs expiring, as well as avoiding each **Lance's** detonation, ^[Prey: Lancepoint] **Prey: Lancepoint** players will plant directly in the middle of their square, while any players' square that is currently being detonated by **Lances** will instead use the **Non-Square Flooring** to resolve their stack. The following sequence should look like:

1. **Lance one Detonates** - **A**/**1**/**B**/**2** players move to the middle of their **Square**, **C**/**3** cross over to the **Non-Square Flooring** using the far edges of their **Square**.
2. **Lance four Detonates** - **C**/**3** cross back into their square.
3. **Lance five Detonates** - **A**/**1**/**C**/**3** players move to the middle of their **Square**, **B**/**2** cross over to the **Non-Square Flooring** using the far edges of their **Square**.
4. **Lance eight Detonates** - **B**/**2** cross back into their square.
5. **Lance nine Detonates** - **B**/**2**/**C**/**3** players move to the middle of their **Square**, **A**/**1** cross over to the **Non-Square Flooring** using the far edges of their **Square**.
6. **Lance twelve Detonates** - **All players** move to the far corner of their squares to avoid **Critical Axeblow**.

After **Critical Axeblow**, **all players** should return to their square. **Magitaur** will cast **Forked Fury**, followed by **two Augmented auto attacks** and finally **Holy** again. Players must destroy the **Blue and **Purple Conduits** to prevent a raid wipe.

Finally, **Magitaur** will use one more [**Assassin's Dagger**](#assassin-s-dagger) sequence, with no changes, before casting a **hard enrage** at **8:00**.

Defeating **Magitaur** completes **The Forked Tower: Blood**. Congratulations!

First-timers can climb the stairs beyond the boss to find **Entry #30** in the **Occult Record**, as well as claim their **Demon Haul** mount from the **Achievements** window.
