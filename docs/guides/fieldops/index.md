##

Field Operations are a special type of side-content set in large open-world instances where players can team up to complete various open-world objectives and special events. 

There are currently three different field operations available in FFXIV:

- **The Forbidden Land, Eureka** (Stormblood)
- **Save the Queen: Blades of Gunnhildr** (Shadowbringers)
- **The Occult Crescent** (Dawntrail)

Field Operations provide a wide variety of content, including unique challenges, rewards, and opportunities for exploration. They are designed to be completed with a group of players, encouraging teamwork and coordination. 

Each Field Operation also includes unique mechanics and systems that create unique gameplay, such as the elemental system in Eureka that gives players and enemies elemental strengths and weaknesses.

## How to Access Field Operations

To access Field Operations, players must first complete the required quests to unlock them. Each Field Operation has its own set of prerequisites, which typically involve reaching a certain level and completing specific quests in the main story.

- **The Forbidden Land, Eureka** can be accessed by completing the quest "And We Shall Call It Eureka" in Rhalgr's Reach (X: 9.8, Y: 12.5) after the stormblood main story quest "Stormblood".
- **Save the Queen: Blades of Gunnhildr** can be accessed by completing a series of quests in Gangos, for more information see the Wiki here: [Bozjan Southern Front](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Bozjan_Southern_Front).
