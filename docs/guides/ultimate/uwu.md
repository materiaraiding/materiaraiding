## Written Guide

The Weapon's Refrain is a multi-phase fight that covers an alternative retelling of the Warrior of Light's fight against the Primals and the Ultima Weapon.

::: info NOTE
This fight is commonly referred to as **UWU** for *Ultima Weapon: Ultimate*, and frankly I agree its a better abbreviation than **TWR** too...
:::

The fight will see you squaring off against Garuda, Ifrit and Titan before completing a LB3-filled intermission with Lahabrea, then facing the Ultima Weapon itself, angrier than ever.

This guide is based off the original and very detailed guide by Clees, which can be found below:

<Action title='Clees Guide' color='purple' href='https://ultimates.guide/uwu/' />

#### Awakening

Throughout the first 3 phases, you will be aiming to complete special requirements to **Awaken** all three Primals. Handling mechanics in a certain way gives the boss an **Aetherically Charged** buff - 4 stacks of this awakens the boss. Once awoken, their mechanics may change and they will drop a puddle (candy) when they die. This must be picked up as they provide extra LB3's later, which are required to clear the fight.

We set this specific order to pick up the candies to keep things consistent and organised: <br> **Healer (Garuda) > Caster (Ifrit) > Melee (Titan)**

You will know who has the candy if they have the **Beyond Limits** buff.

::: warning
The candy spawns where the boss dies - if it is not your role's turn to pick up the candy, **steer clear**.
:::

### Phase 1: Garuda
<Action title='Toolbox' color='red' href='https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=882261013862561&preview=1' />

#### Important Mechanics
::: everyone
Feather Rain Garuda will make a shriek sound and without any castbar, feathers will drop on multiple players' current position. Upon hearing the scream, move out to dodge. If hit by a feather, this will apply a DoT that requires heavy healing to survive. Being hit by 2 or more feathers is generally lethal. Feather Rain will occur multiple times during the fight.

**Friction** Garuda casts a small heavy AoE on a single target that is to be soaked with the party, applying **Thermal Low** to anyone hit. This debuff can be stacked if hit by multiple Frictions without cleansing. Party needs to be tightly stacked for the AoE soak.
:::

::: tank
Slipstream A dodge-able frontal cleave, be careful not to face this into the party.

Downburst A heavy physical tankbuster which will require mitigation.
:::

This summary is written to accompany the above toolbox - use it as a reference.

The phase starts with the glossary MT pulling Garuda to mid and facing her north. DPS should be behind the boss and OT, alongside healers stay east with the OT between healers and the boss. One healer will get Minstral Song and the boss will send a ranged attack to the marked healer, in which OT will soak the hit for the healers (first hit takes more damage).

The Mistral Song leaves behind a large green AoE circle (tornado) which will instantly kill you if you remain within, so the MT should drag the boss west (opposite of where the Minstral Song occurred), onto the D Waywark, then re-face the boss north. The party should follow, staying behind Garuda.

#### Plumes
Multiple **Satin Plumes** will spawn around the arena, plus a **Spiny Plume** just under Garuda. OT needs to grab the Spiny Plume and be ready for heavy damage.

::: warning
STOP AOE IMMEDIATELY. The Spiny Plume will become fixated on the first person to deal damage to it and this MUST be the OT. It cannot be provoked after fixating on a target.
:::

Garuda then casts Slipstream, into a Downburst. The plumes will then move to the party. Once the plumes have gathered on the party, AOE them down **but being careful not to kill the Spiny Plume**. The Spiny Plume will attack the OT, giving them a stack of **Thermal Low**. This does tankbuster levels of damage so mitigation is necessary.

Garuda will then cast Feather Rain. Move out. After Feather Rain, wait for the OT to take second a hit from the Spiny Plume (indicated by 2 stacks of **Thermal Low**), then kill the Spiny Plume to spawn a bubble. Be sure to dodge the AoE indicating the spawning of the bubble (ideally by moving towards the middle), then everyone except the OT should walk into the edge, staying tightly stacked.

#### Cleanses
The following is a mechanic where we will take turns to gain and cleanse **Thermal Low** stacks that are applied from **Friction**, by entering and leaving the bubble. The order is very precise and required to be able to clear the fight as this contributes to the progression of **awakening Garuda**. If you fail the order but survive the mechanic, you can still progress further in the fight for prog, but you will not be able to see **Phase 5: Ultima Weapon**. You will gain **Thermal Low** stacks if you are outside the bubble when **Friction** hits you. You will cleanse your **Thermal Low** debuff when you enter the bubble - this deals a heavy raidwide damage. **When a single player cleanses 2 stacks of Thermal Low at once, this gives Garuda a stack to progress her awakening**.

::: tank
OT must have two stacks of Thermal Low before the Spiny Plume dies.
:::

- Kill the Spiny Plume, everyone except OT moves into the bubble.
- Garuda casts **Mistral Shriek** (raidwide damage). Healers should top players immediately.
- Once players are topped, OT enters bubble to cleanse stacks. +1 awakening charge.
- OT, D1 and D2 leave the bubble and wait outside. **It is important to still be stacked close to the party**.
- Friction 1: Heavy party damage, stacks applied to OT and D1+D2. Party leaves bubble - heal up.
- Friction 2: Heavy party damage, Stacks applied to everyone. OT, D1 and D2 should have 2 stacks while everyone else has 1.
- Wait for party to be healed, D1 cleanses stacks (enter bubble). +1 awakening charge.
- Wait for party to be healed, D2 cleanses stacks (enter bubble). +1 awakening charge.

::: healer
This is one of the biggest damage checks in this phase, use your big mits/CDs and don't be afraid to spam heal.
:::

::: warning
Stay relatively stacked during this mechanic, **Friction** has a small range and can miss people if you are too spread out.
:::

::: info NOTE
If you did this mechanic correctly, the boss will now have 3 stacks of awakened and the OT will be back on 2 stacks. The last stack to Awaken the boss will apply later.
:::

As the bubble only lasts temporarily (~approximately 20 seconds), the mechanic must be completed in a timely manner. Afterwards, Garuda will cast Feather Rain. Move out. She will momentarily become untargetable, before returning to the centre to cast **Aerial Blast**, which is raidwide damage to be mitigated and healed through. The party should stay stacked (except for MT who is facing her northwards) for an upcoming Feather Rain.

#### Twins
Garuda will then spawn 2 sisters, who cast Feather Rain. Move out - all non-tank party members should head towards and stack on **Waymark 4** to evade **Eye of the Storm** (AoE on the outer ring of the arena). **Ensure Garuda is as centred as possible**. Minstral Song will target two non-tanks from the 2 sisters, who will now be on 2 different cardinals. MT and OT need to dodge Wicked Wheel PBAOE centred around Garuda) and stand on a cardinal in-front of each sister against edge of the blue circle (**Eye of the Storm**), intercepting one of the Minstral Songs each.

::: tank
Tanks will need to make sure they intercept one of the sisters' Minstral Songs each. There are a few different ways commonly used to solve this, communicate with your cotank to make sure you understand which method you are using to solve it. 

- MT Prioritize North first
- OT Prioritize South first
- If they spawn East/West, MT takes West, OT takes East

or...

- MT CW from North
- OT CCW from West

Generally you can kinda use-eyes and solve the positions pretty fast, you can stay near the middle of the room to allow fast adjustments. 
:::

The sisters will cast Feather Rain again. While doing so, the party needs to avoid the large AoE tornado left behind by the Minstral Song (they spawn on where the tank soaked them) and then group up towards mid.

::: info NOTE
If tornadoes (Mistral Song puddles) are on SOUTH and EAST, ranged can dodge out towards the wall for safety.
:::

#### Tethers
A second set of **Satin Plumes** will spawn - wait for them to gather and AOE them down as fast as possible. Garuda will cast Slipstream, so the MT must maintain her facing north. The sisters spawn on the west and east cardinals with tethers. These tethers will cast **Mesohigh**, which cleanses **Thermal Low**, resulting in raidwide damage. Taking a **Mesohigh** tether without **Thermal Low** will instantly kill the player. OT (who should have 2 stacks - this is essential to awaken Garuda!) takes WEST Tether (on D Waymark), D4 takes EAST Tether (on B waymark). As the **Mesohigh** tethers resolve, Garuda will awaken, there will be heavy raidwide damage and a Downburst on MT, followed by Feather Rain. Move out!

::: damage
D4 - as your **Satin Plume** will be out of the party, you can single target damage your add. Other players can help you too if they kill the remaining adds early.
:::

Failing to kill the adds in a timely manner will cause them to explode, putting everyone to sleep.

The party should then move behind Garuda and burn down the boss, who should be close to dying. **Be careful not to kill Garuda before the Mesohigh tethers happen or she will not awaken - hold DPS if needed**!

If you don't phase, you will need to look out for Wicked Wheel, a quick donut/AOE dodge, followed by repeated mechanics.

When you kill Garuda, DPS and tanks stack middle, healer grabs the Glowing Puddle (Candy).

By the end of this phase, these players should still have 1 stack of **Thermal Low**: MT, both healers and D3.

### Phase 2: Ifrit
<Action title='Toolbox' color='red' href='https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=562530446784261&preview=1' />

#### Important Mechanics
::: tank
Incinerate Untelegraphed triple tankbuster with no broadcast. Typically use invlunerability to resolve.
:::

::: healer
Searing Wind One of the two healers will be targeted with a debuff. This will last for some time and cause periodic explosions around you. Anyone caught in this will be knocked back and likely die. When you have this, watch the debuff and ensure you are out of the party stack.

Vulcan Burst Large low-damage AOE with knockback. The knockback can be avoided by applying shields (preferred method) or an anti-knockback ability (backup method).
:::

::: damage
Eruptions Ifrit will target the furthest players and cast a series of large explosions beneath them. These will be baited by D3 and D4, and need to be baited away from the party. During Nails, you will use these to buff the nails for awakening.
:::

This summary is written to accompany the above toolbox - use it as a reference.

Once Garuda dies and the candy is collected, everyone should stack mid. Ifrit will spawn on a cardinal - orient your camera to face Ifrit and dodge directly left or right based on the available safe-spot (use sprint if you need more time to identify the safe spot).

The party should then stack at Waymark A with tanks facing the boss at Waymark C. The OT should grab initial aggro to invuln the first tankbuster. Ifrit will cast **Hellfire** - raidwide damage.

The **shield healer** should prepare for Vulcan Burst with shields and OT prepare for Incinerate with an invuln. After the third incinerate, MT should provoke back.

::: info NOTE
If the shield healer is unavailable to shield (e.g. died during transition), use your anti-knockback after Hellfire. Tanks with party shields (e.g. Warrior Shake it Off) can be a good backup alternative, too.
:::

#### Nails
Four nails will spawn in a trapezium formation - orient yourself so the closest two nails (tapering end) are the new relative north. One healer will get Searing Wind and they are to take this to relative south and stay on the wall. As they will be isolated, this healer will use their resources to top themselves up as necessary and focus on attacking Ifrit. The non-Searing Wind healer needs to bear the responsbility of keeping the party alive for this section.

The OT will be tethered to a random DPS - try to stay close to them, but focus on nails/Ifrit. This tether will reduce damage done based on stacks and stacks increase with distance.

Ranged players will split and bait 4 Eruptions at D3 SW and D4 SE, moving up to hit each nail twice with the AoE's. The explosions will cause the nails to grow - once the nails have been hit twice, destroy them in the following order. Killing a nail that has grown twice gives Ifrit a stack to progress his awakening.

![](/images/nails.webp)

::: healer
Non-Searing Wind healer - killing a nail results in raidwide damage that amps up with each nail killed. Stay towards the middle ensure the party is topped up.
:::

The order in which Infernal Nails are destroyed will determine the order of Ifrit’s **Crimson Cyclone** charges (commonly referred to as dashes) in a later phase (i.e. the first Crimson Cyclone comes from the same location as the first nail that was killed). This is a very tight DPS window and you will need to ensure you weaken the nails to kill them quickly once they are fully grown. At the same time, you must avoid killing them before before they are fully grown. If killed before they are fully grown, you can still continue to prog - just bear in mind you will not make it to **Phase 5: Ultima Weapon**.

::: info NOTE
If this is done correctly, the boss will now be awakened.
:::

Ifrit will briefly become untargetable and recentre. He will then cast **Hellfire** for raidwide damage to mitigate and heal through. If a nail survived before this raidwide, **Hellfire** will wipe the party.

The MT will now pull the boss between the two waymarks closest to the relative north set during nails against the wall. D3 and D4 will go SE of relative north and begin baits for 4 Eruptions, rejoining the group counter-clockwise on the wall.

::: healer
One healer will get Searing Wind, go to relative WEST of the party and wait for the debuff to expire. You can rejoin the party when the debuff drops. Note: Searing Wind lasts longer when Ifrit is awakened.
:::

Ifrit clones will prepare to **Crimson Cyclone** dash across the (relative) intercardinals of the arena. We are already in position to avoid them and they go off shortly after the final **Eruption** baits. Next, Ifrit afflicts the other healer with Searing Wind (at this point, if the boss is awakened, there will still be ~15 seconds remaining on the first Searing Wind).

With good DPS, you will phase just as the second healer gets Searing Wind. Second Searing Wind should be run out of the party either south, or east if you are confident that the party will skip dashes.

Before dashes, Ifrit will mark a player with **Flaming Crush**, dealing AoE damage to be soaked by the party.

::: healer
If Ifrit dies very shortly after **Flaming Crush** resolves, make your way back to the party ASAP along the wall (avoid running to the middle as a proximity AoE originating from the centre is incoming) and top everyone up.
:::

#### Dashes
Ifrit is untargetable for the duration of this mechanic.

If you do not phase the boss, the party will remain stacked where they are with the first Searing Wind healer joining them (as it should be expired at this point). The second Searing Wind healer will be directly opposite the party on the other side (relative south).

When Ifrit spawns, rotate if needed to ensure you have empty spot to your right (no Ifrit). You will see one Ifrit glowing - ff this is on a cardinal relative to the party, you will dodge 2 places to the right, otherwise just one.

Afterwards, Ifrit will become targetable again. Kill the boss as quickly as you can after. There will be an Incinerate (which the MT will need to invuln) and more Eruptions coming which you want to skip if possible.

Upon death, move to the wall, ready for Titan to spawn as he will jump in the centre, dealing proximity-based damage. After Titan drops, **D4** (or any magical DPS) should grab the candy from where Ifrit died. **Everyone else - be sure not to run over it**!

### Phase 3: Titan
<Action title='Toolbox' color='red' href='https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=982261963862561&preview=1' />

The following is written to accompany the diagrams in the above toolbox.

#### Important Mechanics
::: everyone
Weight of the Land Several large AoEs appear under players one after another.

Landslides Multiple Line AoEs radiating out from boss. When Awakened, these will happen much faster and twice - dodge into the first set to avoid the second set.

Geocrush Titan will turn to a cardinal and jump, crashing down at the side he was facing. This deals heavy proximity damage based on his landing location. The room will shrink in size.
:::

::: tank
Mountain Buster Heavy Tankbuster with frontal cleave.
:::

#### Summary
The fight starts with **Earthern Fury**, a heavy raidwide. Healers will need to be prepared for this at the end of Ifrit.

The OT should take initial aggro of Titan and face him towards the C Waymark, as he will use Mountain Buster. This should generally be kitchen sink mitigated. The MT can provoke back after.

The party should be on the A Waymark, ready to dodge Weight of the Land. Afterwards, Titan will jump away for **Geocrush**. **Pay attention to where he faced as he jumped**, and walk to the edge opposite of where he looked.

::: tank
Geocrush is very fast. You MUST watch Titan carefully to work out which cardinal he is jumping to. Tanks should always try move boss to the middle of the room before this happens otherwise it can be very difficult to tell which cardinal he is jumping to.
:::

#### Granite Gaols
Once he lands, the party should stack directly in front of Titan. Look behind you to check where the bombs spawn at the back of the room - there are two possible combinations. Titan will knock you back (**cannot be cancelled**) and you must land in the safe spot.

![](/images/jails.webp)

Use the boss target marker as a reference for where to stand - you don't need to move far at all.

![](/images/jailsleftright.webp)

After the knockback, 3 people will have a yellow ticking circle beneath them, indicating they will be trapped in a gaol. In Party Finder, we generally use the melon to order the gaol players with 1, 2 and 3 markers. Before they are trapped, Titan will use Landslides, this is baited by a random player so it is imperative that everyone runs down the middle after being knocked back to avoid blocking people's pathing, especially for gaol-afflicted players.

**Players without Gaols** 
- Run up the middle until Landslides spawn, then move to the left side of the room and stay out of the way.

**Players with Gaols** 
- Check your number and work out your Waymark. In a straight line down from Titan, there will be 3 Waymarks lined up vertically - 1 goes closest to Titan, 2 being middle and 3 being furthest from Titan.
- Run up the middle until Landslides spawn, sidestep to the edge of Landslides next to your Waymark.
- As soon as the Landslides animation disappears, immediately move towards your Waymark. You can use **sprint** if you think you won't reach your Waymark in time. You should get stunned just as you arrive.
- There will be a bomb at the back of the room that explodes - if the gaols are positioned correctly, it will result in a chain explosion of all the gaols.
- The gaol explosions **leave deadly puddles** - exit to the **left** of your puddle immediately. Avoid moving diagonally as your puddles of your fellow gaolers overlap and you don't want to run into those.

::: danger IMPORTANT
Gaols MUST be positioned in-line with the Waymarks. Generally players can stand towards the middle of the Waymark but to be safe, it is a good idea for (if we treat Titan as relative north): Gaol 3 to be a nudge more towards the northern part of their waymark, and Gaol 1 to be a nudge more towards the southern part of their waymark, so they are both closer a tad to Gaol 2 and ensure the chain explosion lands.
:::

![](/images/jailsfinal.webp)

If all three bombs puddles are correctly overlapping, the puddle left by Gaol 1 will be within Titan's hitbox, giving him stacks to progress his awakening. He will fully awaken by the time the puddles disappear. This will greatly increase the speed of mechanics and change their patterns throughout the rest of the fight.

Titan uses a set of 8 Tumults and deals heavy party-wide damage, healers will need to be ready for this.

The party can move up to Titan on the left side of the puddles.

#### Landslides
The party will now stack on the left side looking at Titan, ready to move for Weight of the Land. Dodge through Titan and prepare for Landslides. If awakened, each Landslide set will now be immediately followed by a second set of Landslides between the first set. 

![](/images/landslides.webp)

Watch for the first set - as soon as you see the Landslide visual disappear, you want to **immediately move into the first set of Landslides** to avoid the second set. This is **VERY** fast.

Titan will once again face a direction and use Geocrush. After the Landslides, MT should endeavour to recentre the boss to easily identify where Titan is jumping to.

After this, one healer will be targeted with a Granite Gaol. This healer should move to the middle of the room. Once the Gaol is active, the party will be able to target and damage the Gaol. Break the healer out of the Gaol before Titan begins a set of Landslides followed shortly by 6 Tumults. Remember to dodge into the first Landslide as he will do a double set.

From there on, the boss should be positioned far north, facing the wall. Everyone should be stacked behind Titan in the middle of the room.

After the final Tumult, Titan will follow up with a Mountain Buster combo and summon 4 bomb boulders in the center of the room. The party will be stacked behind the boss and immediately after the Mountain Buster cleave, move through the boss and meet at the wall.

This is a modification of the Mario Kart strategy which allows some uptime.

Ranged and healers will dodge clockwise along the wall, carefully avoid the Weight of the Land and Landslides, continuing clockwise around the room.

Tanks and melee rotate counter-clockwise > clockwise > counter-clockwise for the Weight of the Land. This will allow uptime while providing enough space to avoid Landslides. 

Keep in mind - if nobody in your group is targeted for Weight of the Land, you will still need to move as if you're dodging it. **Remember to dodge into the Landslide!**

Avoid the bombs going off in the centre - stay at the edge of the room.

The goal with this uptime strategy is for Landslides to be baited on a ranged player, leaving a safe area behind Titan.

Typically Titan will die around this point depending on your party damage. If you have not finished Titan you will get a few more repeated mechanics until a final enrage. 

- Mountain Buster
- Weight of the Land
- 8x Tumults
- Earthen Fury Enrage

::: danger IMPORTANT
If you have correctly awoken Titan, he will drop a small candy puddle. This must be picked up by a Melee party member.

### Phase 4: Lahabread Intermission
The following phase will be a set of 4x LB3s. To complete this, the players with the **Beyond Limits** (candy collectors) buff can use their LB3 and it will automatically regenerate.

::: info NOTE
You can leave any dead party members on the ground given they are not the caster or healer with the **Beyond Limits** buff, as they will be resurrected for free in this phase without head empty. However, if they are in the wall, they will need a proper resurrection otherwise they will die immediately.
:::

#### Caster LB3
Four ships/pillars crash dealing heavy proximity AoE damage. Healers will need to ensure party members are healed up for this. Party stack middle to avoid unnecessary deaths. 

6 Magitech bits spawn on the outside of the arena, casting **Self-Destruct**. Use Caster LB3 in the middle of the room to destroy all the bits. Players should be hitting the bits as the LB3 leaves them on 1 hit. 

::: info NOTE
Use Caster LB3 when the freefire damage appears on your screen, the rest of the LBs can be used as soon as they are available.
:::

#### Healer LB3
Lahabrea will cast blight, dropping all players to 1HP and applying Doom. Use Healer LB3 to dispel Doom and heal all players. This cannot be removed by normal dispel or healing to full. 

#### Melee LB3 
Lahabread becomes targetable and begins casting an instant-wipe Dark IV. Immediately use Melee LB3 when available to defeat Lahabread and prevent the cast. Other players can attack Lahabread and is a great chance to build job gauge if needed.

#### Tank LB3
The Ultima Weapon will appear and cast **Ultima** to wipe the party. A tank will need to use LB3 to mitigate the damage - activate it as soon as possible.

With all the LB3s complete, you will now begin the Ultima Weapon phases.

### Phase 5: Ultima Weapon
The Ultima Weapon will spawn and use abilities absorbed from the Primals. This includes a number of new mechanics.

During the RP where the Ultima Weapon consumes the Primals, non tank players should fan out along the wall of the north-west quadrant of the room. This will become everyone's designated position for **Ultimate Suppression**, a mechanic later in this phase. Once spots are confirmed, everyone can return to the centre of the arena.

::: danger IMPORTANT
During this phase, the Ultima Weapon will have a Duty Gauge bar (Ultima Aether) that slowly fills up, increasing with mechanics but also each death. When this bar fills, the Ultima Weapon gains a massive Damage Up buff which will likely result in a wipe. Increases by 4 with some mechanics and 4 for each death.
:::

- Ultima Massive raidbuster dealing extremely heavy magic damage. Must be mitigated via the use of a tank LB3.
- Tank Purge Heavy raidwide magic damage.
- Homing Lasers Very heavy tankbuster (~125k unimitigated) targeting the player with the second highest enmity, in a small circle around them.
- Viscous Aetheroplasm AoE attack applying the Viscous Aetheroplasm debuff, which explodes after a short period of time for heavy magic damage that can be soaked with the party.
- Diffractive Laser Cleaving tankbuster with no cast time dealing moderate magic damage.
- Aetheric Boom Knockback originating from the Ultima Weapon, hitting all players. It is accompanied by 4 sets of Aetheroplasms.

After consuming all Primals, the Ultima Weapon begins the phase at the north of the room. 

::: info NOTE
If your class requires any preparation (e.g. prepping Standard Step or Earthly Star), note that when the Ultima Weapon 'chomps' Garuda, it is about ~15 seconds till the boss is targetable. For optimal pot timing, listen to the game music and use your pot when you hear the first drumroll.
:::

::: warning
You will need to have LB3 again towards the end of the fight. **Do not use targeted mitigations** (Feint, Addle, Reprisal, etc.) for the entire phase as this will reduce LB generation.
:::

DPS and healers begin the phase stacked in the middle of the room. Open with burst phase and continue with damage.

MT starts on the west side of the Ultima Weapon, with OT on the east. The OT will provoke the boss on the first GCD - MT will then provoke on second GCD to ensure that MT is TOP aggro and OT is second. 

The Ultima Weapon starts with Tank Purge. They will then apply Viscous Aetheroplasm to the highest aggro target (MT). Ensure the MT is NOT standing with the party as Viscous Aetheroplasm is a small AoE. Normally, MT can then rejoin party.

This is followed by Homing Lasers on OT. Kitchen sink as it is heavy damage. 

The Ultima Weapon will begin one of three sub-phases, each with a passive and active set of mechanics. The first is **Ultimate Predation**.

::: info NOTE
**LB Cheesing**

By the end of **Ultimate Suppression**, we need to have a full LB3 bar again to survive the next attack. We've already mentioned not to use any targeted mitigations - but sometimes this is not enough. LB cheesing the first **Tank Purge** (i.e. generating extra LB by having less HP than the damage of the raidwide when it occurs, but surviving due to shields and party mitigations) is a good way to maximise LB generation. 

There's no single set-in-stone way to do it and you may need to adjust what abilities you use based on your tank composition. Use the below as a **GUIDELINE**. There is a lot of time during the RP of the Ultima Weapon consuming the Primals and this is a good opportunity for supports to discuss what abilities they will use, should the party opt for LB cheesing.

After the **Ultima** raidwide during the intermission, the regen healer is NOT to use any healing abilities. Then:

If **Scholar**: After the Ultima Weapon chomps Garuda, begin using Adloquium on a tank to try an get a crit shield proc. Once achieved, deploy/spread the shield. If you find a crit shield before the boss becomes targetable, spread it anyway. Pop down Sacred Soil. If you do not have the support of tank shields, you can use a Succor (**WITHOUT** Emergency Tactics) for a small party heal just to be safe. Don't stress about your fairy passive healing - it will not single-handedly top your party up but if desired, you can optionally dismiss the fairy until the beginning of the phase.

If **Sage**: After the Ultima raidwide, use 1 Prognosis. Then, before the Ultima Weapon becomes targetable, use Zoe + Eukrasian Prognosis and Kerachole. If you have the support of tank shields (e.g. Shake it Off) from a tank, you can omit the Prognosis.

**Tanks**: you can use Divine Veil / Heart of Light. If using Shake it Off, it must be used JUST before the raidwide due to its heal over time effect. The MT can optionally solo the Viscous Aetheroplasm stack with kitchen sinked mitigations instead of sharing it with the party to built a little bit of extra LB.
:::

### Phase 5.1: Ultimate Predation

#### Passive Phase
The Ultima Weapon is untargetable for this section.

Ultimate Predation begins with a dodge mechanic - all Primals and the Ultima Weapon will appear around the arena. You will need to find one of several safe-spots to survive this mechanic. 

- The Ultima Weapon will perform a large AoE on one quadrant of the arena.
- Ifrit will first dash across the arena, before executing a **Crimson Cyclone** which covers all cardinals.
- Garuda will use a **Wicked Wheel**, covering almost half the arena.
- Titan will appear on a cardinal and use an awoken **Landslide** with two sets.

This mechanic can be very overwhelming but it is simplest to break it down into a few logical steps to resolve.

1. First, look for Garuda who will be off-centre and avoid either cardinal on her side of the room - these are out-of-bounds. 
2. Run to either of the one or two remaining cardinals that do NOT have Titan on them. Take note of where the Ultima Weapon is, as you will need to avoid them later.

![](/images/313371348-2696d8f8-efe3-4b69-afe4-96114650aee6.webp)

3. Wait at the wall. Titan will begin Landslides, you may need to dodge these near the cardinal.
4. After the first Landslide, immediately dodge into a clear intercardinal, making sure not to dodge towards the Ultima Weapon.
5. When dodging into an intercardinal you MUST stop at the wall using the pattern on the outside of the room to stop at the 4th visible rune. See the image below: 

![](/images/313372251-7da1c4c4-1447-4921-ae9a-37f7f22d7827.webp)

![](/images/313372088-64c362b6-208e-4da5-aa0e-a071e6267540.webp)

Your final goal is to reach one of several possible safespots. Some of the options are VERY tight so make sure you stay close to the wall and use the runes on the wall to find the safe spot accurately. 

After the main mechanics resolve, Garuda will perform another Feather Rain. Do not move until you hear the shriek to avoid dropping AoE's on your party members.

#### Active Phase
The Ultima Weapon becomes targetable in the middle of the room. The MT will pull the Ultima Weapon slightly northwest at the A Waymark, then join the party stacking north on the visible second-line on the floor. D3 and D4 will stay towards the south to bait 4 Eruptions from Ifrit. If there is a death from the first section of **Ultimate Predation**, back-up baiters should be prepared (ideally healers or any other ranged player). During this section, the autoattacks on the MT **hurt**, so healers keep an eye on their HP. 

After the **Eruption** baits, the Ultima Weapon surrounds the outside of the arena with **Radiant Plumes** (large deadly AoEs). Boulders will be falling on the centre, leaving you very little room between the plumes and boulders. Stay on the 2nd line and move out to the 3 Waymark as soon as plumes resolve. Titan is also baited to the southeast intercardinal as he drops at the furthest intercardinal from the Ultima Weapon. This sets up Titan for a consistent Landslides pattern.

Landslides will be baited as soon as plumes resolve by moving north to the wall, then clockwise into the safe spot. The Ultima Weapopn will also cast a Landslide - however only Titan's will be awoken, hitting a 2nd time after the Ultima Weapon's Landslide resolves. Titan's Landslide resolves, then the Ultima Weapon's Landslide resolves. Titan readies an untelegraphed 2nd hit, in which the party will need to dodge back to immediate north. 

The MT will go to the left side of the Ultima Weapon facing in (east), and the rest of the party will stack on the right (west) facing the boss. The OT will be tethered to a random DPS - this is just like the one during Ifrit nails, where they must stay grouped together. With the party minus the MT stacked together, it will naturally resolve. 

The Ultima Weapon will cast a series of 7x Tumults while the MT will be targeted for Viscous Aetheroplasm and will need to take this away from the party. Once MT receives the aetheroplasm, the OT needs to provoke. This ensures that MT will take both the Viscous Aetheroplasm and the Homing Lasers (as they are now 2nd aggro) and this will be **taken with their invulnerability**. The timing for the invulnerability is just after the upcoming scream for Feather Rain.

Garuda and her sisters spawn - Garuda will use **Mistral Shriek** dealing heavy raidwide damage, followed by her sisters with two sets of Feather Rain. This is very high damage output and healers will need to spend heavily to ensure the party survives. The party should stay stacked together and dodge Feather Rain by moving counter-clockwise around the boss. Being careful to avoid the MT side of the boss. 

After the first set of Feather Rain, the Viscous Aetheroplasm pops, then after the second set, Homing Lasers resolves. Both are fully handled by the MT with invulnerability.

The Ultima Weapon will teleport to the north side of the arena. Facing the boss, stack tight on the SW side (his right foot) in preparation for **Ultimate Annihilation**.

### Phase 5.2: Ultimate Annihilation

#### Passive Phase
Although this is considered a passive phase, the Ultima Weapon will be targetable for this section. Stack up tight on the southwest side of boss hitbox. 

This mechanic starts with a series of 3 Weight of the Land AoE's. The party needs to remain stacked together - a player will be marked with **Flaming Crush**, a party stack. The AoE of the attack is **very small**, so it is important to stay as tightly grouped as possible. For the first 2 Weight of the Land sets, firstly dodge right, then left, back to where you started. For the third set - the party will now split up as all 3 Primals will begin a variety of attacks. 

Here's what will actually happen starting from the third set of Weight of the Land. We will explain after how we resolve them - depending on your role, some mechanics may not be your responsibility to handle but it's always good to be aware of them: 
- An **Aetheroplasm orb** spawns just southeast of the boss that must be soaked. Garuda spawns a **Mesohigh** tether, then uses **Eye of the Storm** into Feather Rain. Ifrit afflicts a healer with Searing Wind.
- Another orb spawns, same location. Titan will perform a double **Landslide** (not baited - fixed location for this one) from a southern intercardinal and Ifrit dashes across the arena from an intercardinal into a **Crimson Cyclone** on the cardinals.
- A third orb spawns, same location. Garuda will use **Eye of the Storm** again, and spawn another **Mesohigh** tether. After the tether resolves, there is another Feather Rain.
- A fourth orb spawns, same location. The Ultima Weapon casts Tank Purge.

Below is how we resolve all these mechanics, depending on your role.

::: tank
After the third **Weight of the Land**, move east and soak the orb together. Move towards the boss's left flank to bait Feather Rain and once Garuda shrieks, dodge back to where you soaked the orb, then soak the second orb together. After, stack dead north (3 Waymark) with the DPS and NON-Searing Wind healer. Your next step depends on which tank role you are:

OT once Ifrit dashes across the arena from an intercardinal, immediately run counter-clockwise to the 2 Waymark (it is worthwhile to use sprint) to not only avoid **Crimson Cyclone**, but also dodge Titan's double Landslides. After the **Crimson Cyclone**, run inwards to avoid Garuda's **Eye of the Storm** (donut AoE) and remain with the party. You don't need to soak the last 2 orbs. Dodge the last Feather Rain.

MT once Ifrit dashes across the arena from an intercardinal, immediately run clockwise, reaching where Titan's first Landslide was to avoid **Crimson Cyclone** and the second Landslide. Once the **Crimson Cyclone** resolves, you can dash back into the Ultima Weapon to avoid **Eye of the Storm** (donut AoE) and solo soak the third orb. Stay there, and just as the fourth orb appears and is solo soaked, move for Feather Rain.

Tank Purge occurs at the end.
:::

::: healer
After the third **Weight of the Land**, move west. One of you will be afflicted with Searing Wind.

**NON-Searing Wind** make your way dead north (3 Waymark) to group with the other DPS and OT. Be mindful that Feather Rain occurs during this time so watch where other DPS have walked, avoiding their path. As the other healer with Searing Wind needs to distance themselves from the party, it will be your job to solo-heal everyone for the remainder of **Ultimate Annihilation**. Once north, wait for Ifrit to dash across the intercardinal - once he does, immediately run counter-clockwise to the 2 Waymark (it is worthwhile to use sprint) to not only avoid **Crimson Cyclone**, but also dodge Titan's double Landslides. After the **Crimson Cyclone**, run inwards to avoid Garuda's **Eye of the Storm** (donut AoE). Just be on the safe edge and do not run too inwards - tanks will be soaking orbs, and your Searing Wind cohealer will be exploding south. The Ultima Weapon will then cast Tank Purge. As this goes off, Garuda will also Feather Rain. Dodge and heal the party.

Searing Wind make your way hard south, away from the party - you will have Titan and Ifrit beside you. When Titan casts his first **Landslide**, **pop sprint**. Ifrit's dash and Titan's Landslide go off fairly simultaneously - **run into where Ifrit was** to avoid **Crimson Cyclone** and Titan's second Landslide. Immediately after, run inwards just enough to be safe from **Eye of the Storm** and take Garuda's **Mesohigh** tether. **Do not run too far inwards as you are exploding with Searing Wind**. Once the tether resolves, ensure you are topped as Tank Purge is coming and **dodge** Feather Rain. Use your resources to keep yourself alive and do not worry about healing the party - leave this to your NON-Searing Wind cohealer.
:::

::: damage
After the third **Weight of the Land** and **if you are D3**, move south and take Garuda's **Mesohigh** tether around the C Waymark. Once it resolves, make your way dead north (3 Waymark), keeping in mind that Feather Rain occurs during this time so watch where other DPS have walked, avoiding their parth.

If you are not D3, i.e. every other DPS, move north from the third **Weight of the Land** and stay beside the boss's flank. Wait for Feather Rain to occur, then move dead north (3 Waymark).

Once we are all north, wait for Ifrit to dash across through the intercardinal - once he does, immediately run to the 2 Waymark (it is worthwhile to use sprint) to not only avoid **Crimson Cyclone**, but also dodge Titan's double Landslides. After the **Crimson Cyclone**, run inwards to avoid Garuda's **Eye of the Storm** (donut AoE). Just be on the safe edge and do not run too inwards - tanks will be soaking orbs, and there will be a Searing Wind healer exploding south. The Ultima Weapon will then cast Tank Purge. As this goes off, Garuda will also Feather Rain. Dodge.
:::

![](/images/anni.webp)

#### Active Phase


After Tank Purge, the Ultima Weapon will briefly become untargetable and reappear in the centre with Garuda casing **Eye of the Storm**. The Searing Wind still has one more explosion to go before their debuff expires so the afflicted healer must stay in the south part of the safe spot. MT stays north, OT moves northeast (double check the OT is 2nd in aggro here) and the rest of the party remains northwest.

Once **Eye of the Storm** resolves, the searing healer should be safe to return to the party at northwest and the Ultima Weapon will use Homing Lasers, targeted at the OT, given they are 2nd in aggro. Use invulnerability.

If the boss is below 50% HP at this point (which they should be given the run has gone smoothly so far), they will begin casting **Ultimate Suppression**. 

If not, they will continue to repeat the following mechanics until below 50% HP:
- **Eye of the Storm** (donut AoE) into **Radiant Plumes** (middle becomes unsafe). Wait till **Eye of the Storm** resolves before moving out.
- Diffractive Laser will be targeted on current aggro, which will be the MT.
- **Eye of the Storm** with Vulcan Burst, PRE-SHIELD or use anti-knockback.
- Homing Lasers. The boss should *really* be below 50% at this point.

### Phase 5.3: Ultimate Suppression

#### Passive Phase
The Ultima Weapon will become untargetable for this section.

Non-tank players should make their way to their positions that they predetermined during the RP transition to this phase. 

Meanwhile, tanks should stand slightly apart in the middle of the southwest quadrant. Note the Garuda sisters standing behind the D and C Waymarks - your job is to intercept the Minstral Song they will cast on other players. Below is a screenshot taken from Kur Rumi's OT POV:

![](/images/382996515-a7b89d4e-cd72-45fa-9d8d-96efd90b2f20.png)

See how when Minstral Song affected players stand on the yellow spot, both tanks will successfully intercept the attack - this best describes how and why tanks should stand slightly apart within the southwest quadrant.

When the mechanic begins, Ifrit will cast Eruptions on 3 players. **Double check your feet** to see if you are one of these players. Everyone should then begin to converge towards the centre.

::: warning 
From this point, make a big deal of **never running to the wall at any point**. There will be feathers rotating around the perimeters of the arena that simply mean death if you touch them.
:::

Those with Eruptions, continue passing through the middle. One of the players with Eruptions will be targeted to be stunned in a **Granite Gaol** (yellow ticking marker beneath feet) - this player needs to move to Waymark 4 and stay there (the Eruption will not kill you so don't stress). 

The remaining 2 players will *reach* Waymark 4, but then move **northwards** to avoid the Eruption AoE and not walk into the wall. The **Granite Gaol** will become targetable and begin casting **Granite Impact**. This is a DPS check - take down the add before the cast, otherwise it will result in wipe-causing raid damage. As you attack the gaol, there will be 2 sets of Feather Rain to dodge.

For the 3 non-Eruption players: shortly after, 2 players will receive the Minstral Song marker above their ahead and 1 last player will still have nothing. The 2 Minstral Song players, plus the nothing player, will make a right turn and stand behind the tanks (see the yellow spot in the above screenshot). Once the Minstral Songs resolve, stay standing and **WAIT** for that first **Feather Rain to occur**.

When you hear the first Feather Rain, the 2 Minstral Song players and 2 tanks should make their way towards the gaol to assist in killing it. They will naturally avoid the second Feather Rain during their short journey to the gaol.

On the other hand, the remaining player who had nothing (who stood with the Minstral Song players) will be targeted for **Light Pillar**. For a brief period, they will drop small puddles beneath them that are lethal if hit by. So, once that first Feather Rain occurs, they will do a clockwise loop around the arena (**WITHOUT GOING TO THE WALL**) to keep these away from the party. By the time they reach the B Waymark, the gaol should be dead and they are safe to rejoin the party.

![](/images/supp.webp)

During all of these mechanics, the Ultima Weapon will be casting **Aetherochemical Lasers** (green rectangular AoEs) from their hitbox. These are not baited by anyone and will be aimed at the boss's front or diagonals, and generally insignificant to dodge.

Once the gaol is dead, everyone will stack on the B Waymark, ready to bait upcoming Titan Landslides.  There will also be a **Mesohigh** tether and a **Flame Crush** (party stack).
- When the first Landslide set appears, the MT runs **northwards** to take the **Mesohigh** tether. They should then dodge into where that west-most Landslide telegraph was to avoid the second Landslide set. Stay and wait for the **Mesohigh** to resolve.
- For everyone else, when that Landslide telegraph appears - run to Waymark 4 just below. Then, once the first Landslide telegraph disappears, move back to the B Waymark to avoid the second Landslide set and stay grouped for the **Flaming Crush** stack.

When the stack resolves, healers must top everyone ASAP as a raidwide is coming. Stay grouped - there will be a Feather Rain. Once the Feather Rain occurs, players can move out and the Ultima Weapon casts Tank Purge. Heal up again.

#### Active Phase
The Ultima Weapon becomes targetable in the centre of the arena and casts Ultima. This requires a tank LB3 to survive, so if you haven't recharged all of your LB since intermission, it's unfortunately GG.

::: warning 
If you died during **Ultimate Suppression** and are being resurrected, only take the resurrection if you know you will be up to receive the tank LB3. If not, stay dead until Ultima finishes casting otherwise you will just die again.
:::

Once topped from the heavy raidwide, tanks will then stand southwest of the boss hitbox (on their right foot), while everyone else stands southeast of the boss hitbox (on their left foot) in preparation for the next mechanic.

Afterwards, the Ultima Weapon will cast Aetheric Boom, knocking all players back and spawning 4 sets of **Aetheroplasm Orbs** on the intercardinals. We should have LB1 available due to the amount of damage taken from Ultima and a tank should cast LB1 just before the knockback. If not - healers should be ready to pop a few extra party mitigations and healing.

Each set includes 2 orbs tethered to each other that will gradually come together - if they collide, the party will wipe. Thus, **the orbs need to be soaked**, dealing **party-split damage**.

Tanks will take the southwest, then the northwest set of orbs. Kitchen sink mitigations are essential.

The rest of the party will take the southeast, then the northeast set of orbs.

::: healer
Healing between each set is mandatory and party members should ensure they have enough health before taking the second set of orbs.
:::

Once completed, top players up and everyone will gather dead north on Waymark 3, in preparation for the final mechanic of the fight.

::: info NOTE
If you are curious on how the orbs work...

The length of the tethers between orbs in Aetheric Boom is based on how many players soaked the orbs in **Ultimate Annihilation**. The more players that soaked, the longer the tether.

The first 2 orbs were tanked by 2 players (both tanks), which is why the northern orbs in this current mechanic are slightly longer. This gives us some time to reach them. Meanwhile, the orbs that we were knocked back into are already almost touching, because the MT solo soaked them. We soak those orbs straight away so it doesn't matter that the tether length is shorter.
:::

### Phase 5.4: Primal Roulette
During **Primal Roulette**, the 3 Primals will one-by-one execute attacks. Firstly, the Ultima Weapon will afflict 3 players with Viscous Aetheroplasm with 3 different timers. When the timer expires, they will explode for **party stack damage**. It is timed such that there will be **1 party stack per Primal**. Therefore, for each Primal attack, the party must remained as tightly stacked as possible. 

Here is what each Primal does, then after we will detail what possible orders they can attack in:

::: everyone
**Garuda**: she will cast **Wicked Wheel** ( PBAOE ), into a donut AoE. As a group, be on the edge of the point blank AoE, and immediately take a step in as soon as the telegraph disappears. The Viscous Aetheroplasm stack occurs as you walk in for the donut. After, Garuda casts **Aerial Blast** for raidwide damage, then Feather Rain.

**Ifrit**: he will cast a set of Eruptions, then shortly after **Crimson Cyclone** (dash across the arena) on cardinals. The Viscous Aetheroplasm stack occurs after **Crimson Cyclone** goes off. After, Ifrit casts **Hellfire** for raidwide damage.

**Titan**: he will cast 3 sets of Weight of the Land. The Viscous Aetheroplasm stack occurs as the 3rd set of AoE's appear. After, Titan casts **Earthern Fury** for raidwide damage.
:::

::: info NOTE
As all the raidwide damage at the end of each Primal attack is from the Primal and not the Ultima Weapon themself, targeted mitigation (Feint, Addle, Reprisal, etc.) **do not reduce its damage**. You will need to rely on **party mitigation** for the raidwides.
:::

There are 3 possible orders in which they attack. The main thing to note for each order is which way we move to dodge Titan's Weight of the Land but basically, dodge in the direction that will keep you within the quadrant between Waymarks 2 and 3 (north west, if you look at the map)

- **Garuda -> Ifrit -> Titan**

Resolve Garuda as described above. Then, importantly, **WAIT FOR FEATHER RAIN TO HAPPEN** before immediately making your way dead north (on the 3 Waymark).

Once north, as the entire party will be stacked together, Eruptions all go on the one spot - run to the 2 Waymark (intercardinal) to dodge **Crimson Cyclone**.  Stay at 2, ready for Titan.

When the Weight of the Land sets appear, dodge CW -> CCW -> CW. After the raidwide, move towards north, ready to finish off the Ultima Weapon.

- **Ifrit -> Garuda -> Titan**

As everyone will be tightly stacked north, Eruptions all go on the one spot - run to the 2 Waymark (intercardinal) to dodge **Crimson Cyclone**. 

After, move towards the middle to resolve Garuda's out->in AoE. Then, importantly, **WAIT FOR FEATHER RAIN TO HAPPEN** before immediately making your way dead north (on the 3 Waymark), ready for Titan's attack

When the Weight of the Land sets appear, dodge CCW -> CW -> CCW. After the raidwide, move towards north, ready to finish off the Ultima Weapon.

- **Titan -> Ifrit -> Garuda**

When the Weight of the Land sets appear, dodge CCW -> CW -> CCW. After the last dodge, make sure to return dead on the 3 Waymark (north).

Eruptions all go on the one spot - run to the 2 Waymark (intercardinal) to dodge **Crimson Cyclone**. 

After, move towards the middle to resolve Garuda's out->in AoE. Then, importantly, **WAIT FOR FEATHER RAIN TO HAPPEN** before moving north, ready to finish off the Ultima Weapon.

::: info NOTE
For safety, it is recommended to use sprint during Ifrit's section.
:::

### The Ultima Weapon Enrage


After Primal Roulette, the Ultima Weapon teleports north to begin their enrage sequence. They will charge the duty gauge **Ultima Aether** much more rapidly. Once it hits 100, the Ultima Weapon will remove party members from the fight one by one, starting from lowest damage dealt to most damage dealt during this entire phase.

Should you reach this stage - refresh any DoTs before your turn. Depending on how your run has gone, it may still be an LB2 or has recharged to LB3. If you can afford to wait till it's LB3, do so before using it - however, once the enrage sequence starts, players are removed in fairly quick succession so if it can only be an LB2 - just send it!

Good luck!
