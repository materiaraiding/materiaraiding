## Fight Summary

### Opening
Cloud of Darkness will open by using **Blade of Darkness** twice, a telegraphed cleave AoE with 3 variable safe spots depending on the glowing arm she raises.

- If she raises **one** glowing arm, she will swipe the entire arena but leave a small safe spot next to her other arm.
- If she raises **both** glowing arms, she will swipe a large circular area in front of her, requiring players to get away.

::: info NOTE
Getting hit by the cleave only results in Sustained Damage; be mindful of your healing tools if you intend to eat the cleave for uptime.
:::

### Phase 1
Phase 1 is primarily about staying on your feet and keeping track of both your **Grim Embrace** debuff and any stored **Aero IV**/**Death IV** casts before they catch you unaware.

::: tank
For the entirety of this phase, her auto attacks will target the 3 highest emnity players and apply a **stacking vulnerability**.

It's recommended to use some of your personal mitigation for extended periods of auto attacks and swap threat with your co-tank every 4-6 stacks.
:::

::: everyone
In this phase, Cloud of Darkness will take increased damage. Try to deal as much damage as you can here through bursts, potions and even **LB3**.
:::

#### Grim Embrace
Cloud of Darkness starts by casting **Grim Embrace** twice, tethering half the raid with each cast and applying a debuff that will summon a hand facing towards you when it expires. This hand lunges in the direction it's facing and how it faces you is determined by her animation **while you're tethered**.

> - Her hand is **under** the crystal; the hand will spawn **behind** you. Step **backwards** when it spawns.
> ![](/images/cod-handback.webp)

> - Her hand is **in front** of the crystal; the hand will spawn **in front** of you. Step **forwards** when it spawns.
> ![](/images/cod-handfront.webp)

Throughout the phase these debuffs will resolve in batches, requiring players to break away from the raid so as to not hit other players.

::: healer
Players hit by the hands will get a cleansable Doom. Have Esuna on hand, ready to cleanse anyone hit.
:::

**Cloudlets of Darkness** will spawn with an on-screen alert, manifesting in the back of the arena and shooting linear beams in 4 sets. Use the tiles on the ground to help you dodge these.

#### Sequences
From here, the sequence of mechanics splits into two, with one randomly selected sequence playing out here and the other sequence playing out after Phase 2.

::: details Sequence 1
1. **Flares** - One player in each alliance is targeted with a flare, take these to your respective corner.
	> - Alliance A takes the **West** corner.
	> - Alliance B takes the **South** corner.
	> - Alliance C takes the **East** corner.
	> - Everyone else stands along the **North** wall.
2. **Unholy Darkness** - Each healer is targeted with a stack marker.
	> - LP1 of each alliance stands **inside** the boss' hitbox.
	> - LP2 of each alliance stands **along** the boss' hitbox.
3. **Blade of Darkness**
4. **Enaero IV**/**Endeath IV** - Cloud of Darkness will store a cast of **Aero IV** or **Death IV** for later. Read the castbar.
	> - **Aero IV** is a knockback AoE from the centre. Aim to get **knocked back** to a corner.
	> - **Death IV** is a draw-in to the centre, followed by a small pointblank you must walk into after it resolves to avoid the incoming donut. Aim to be **drawn-in** 		from a corner.
	>> ::: healer
	>> Players hit by **Death IV** will get a cleansable Doom. Have Esuna on hand, ready to cleanse anyone hit.
	>> :::
	> - Both the knockback and the draw-in can be nullified with **Arm's Length**/**Surecast**.
5. **Break IV** - Cloud of Darkness and **2 Sinister Eyes** along the edges will cast a **gaze** attack, look away from them all.
6. **Blade of Darkness** + **Aero IV**/**Death IV** - Dodge the cleave. The **Enaero IV**/**Endeath IV** that was stored from before will **resolve here**, directly after the 	cleave.
7. **Cloudlets of Darkness**
8. **Aero IV**/**Death IV**
:::

	> - Everyone else stands along the **North** wall. 
:::

After any of these sequences, the phase will end.

### Phase 2
<Action title='Phase 2' color='purple' href='https://raidplan.io/plan/2f37jWj7XwPBjfix' />
Phase 2 is much more **controlled** in terms of mechanics and positions, but the punishment for failing mechanics are harsh if not accounted for and can quickly lead to a wipe.

To start, Cloud of Darkness will transform the arena into two distinct parts.

::: details Outer Platforms
**2 square platforms** on the **East** and **West**, connected by a large outer ring.

**2 Atomos** populate each side of the outer ring.
> - Killing these will drop a puddle, which when stepped into, will inflict a debuff that **teleports** a player in the indicated direction when resolved.
	>> Use these to teleport to the inner platform **if needed**.
> - If they aren't killed in time, they will **tether** to the closest player, draining their health and healing the boss.
:::

::: details Inner Platform
**1 inner platform**, made up of **tiles** from E9S creating a hashtag (#) shape.

These tiles can **break** under certain circumstances, and **regenerate** after a few seconds if broken. There are visual indicators if the tile is about to break.
> - If **2 or more players** occupy the same tile.
> - If a tile is occupied for **too long**.
	>> - A tile's timer can be **reset** by moving to a different tile.
> - The **general priority** for movement is to allow **Healers** to move first if needed, then **Tanks**, then **DPS**.
:::


Cloud of Darkness also teleports into the middle of the inner platform and summons **2 Stygian Shadows** on the **East** and **West** platforms, damage done to the shadows will be replicated to the Cloud of Darkness at the end of the phase.

When the platforms form, players on the outer platforms get a debuff that **nullifies** any damage they do to **Cloud of Darkness**. Similarly, players on the inner platform get a debuff that **nullifies** any damage they do to the **Stygian Shadows**.

::: info NOTE
**Atomos** are not affected by these debuffs. This means players on the **inner platform** can still hit and kill the **Atomos** if players on the outer platform forget or are unable to.
:::

To resolve all mechanics in this phase and to evenly distribute roles across the arena, we begin with the positions shown in the image below.

Alliance A players are marked in **red**, Alliance B in **yellow** and Alliance C in **blue**.

![](/images/cod-p2start.webp)

::: tank
Make sure to **provoke** your new target. Both here and after **Looming Chaos**.
:::

::: healer
You may be resolving mechanics with a player that isn't in your Alliance and is out of reach of their own healers. Keep an eye on them and help them with **targeted heals** if needed.
:::

From here, this guide will occasionally **split** between players on the **outer platforms** and players on the **inner platforms**. Be sure to read and understand both sides to have better knowledge of any repeated mechanics, as **Looming Chaos** may swap the platform you're on for the rest of the phase.

#### Particle Concentration
::: details Outer Platforms
1. **Third Art of Darkness** - Each shadow will cast a **3-part sequence** of attacks, telegraphed by the amount of glowing orbs she holds up each time.

	| 1 Orb | 2 Orbs | No Orb/Boss Glows |
	| :---: | :---: | :---: |
	| **180° cleave** on glowing orb's side. | Pair stacks on the **3 closest** players. | Beam **spreads**. |
	| ![](/images/cod-p2cleave.webp) | ![](/images/cod-p2pairs.webp) | ![](/images/cod-p2spread.webp) |

	> - A sequence will always be made up of **2 180° cleaves** and **1 pair**/**spread**.
	> - Use the positions above to resolve, mirroring the positions of the **pair**/**spread** if on the **East** platform.
	> - Resolve the pair stacks **before** crossing over to dodge a 180° cleave.
2. **Particle Concentration** - **3-player towers** will spawn opposite of each other on the platform.
	> - MT, H1 and D3 will take the tower that's either **North** or on the **outer side** of the platform.
	> - D1, D2 and D4 will take the tower that's either **South** or on the **inner side** of the platform.
	![](/images/cod-towers.webp)
:::

::: details Inner Platform
1. **Dark Dominion** - A raidwide
1. **Particle Concentration** - A **2-player tower** and a **1-player tower** will appear in each quarter.
	> Use the priority of **Healer > Tank > DPS** to fill the towers accordingly.
	> If you're already in a tower, **stay** where you are.
:::

After the towers resolve, **Cloud of Darkness** will then cast **Ghastly Gloom**, a donut or cross-shaped AoE depending on what shape the clouds form:
- **Donut** -  Outer players huddle against the inner wall of their platform, inner players occupy a tile close to the boss.
- **Cross** - Outer players move Northeast/Southwest on the outer ring, inner players should occupy the 3 tiles in the corner.

**Curse of Darkness** will target all outer players with a debuff that when expires, shoots a protean in the direction they're facing. Simply face towards the wall/away from the party right before this expires.

#### Evil Seeds
::: details Outer Platforms
1. **Evil Seed** - 2 players are targeted with a marker that drops a **lingering puddle** after some time.
	> Take these to the **outer corners** of the platform, before the outer ring.
	![](/images/cod-seedout.webp)
2. **Ghastly Gloom** - This will be the **opposite** shape of what was casted before.
3. **Thorny Vine** - The lingering puddles will target the **closest** player to it with a tether that must be broken by running away.
	> **DPS** will pick up these tethers, with **melee** players taking the **outer seeds** and **ranged** players taking the **inner seeds**. Use the **outer ring** to create distance.
	![](/images/cod-seedtether.webp)
4. **Flood of Darkness** - Each shadow will cast an **interruptible** attack that does **massive damage** + a **bleed** to the entire raid if allowed to finish.
	> **Tanks** will interrupt these with **Interject**. **Phys. Ranged** players can also interrupt this with **Head Graze**.
:::

::: details Inner Platform
1. **Evil Seed** - 2 players **East** and 2 players **West** are targeted with a marker that drops a **lingering puddle** after some time.
	> Take these seeds to the **East**/**West** tiles, keeping the movement priority in mind and place them as shown below.
	![](/images/cod-seedin.webp)
2. **Ghastly Gloom** - This will be the **opposite** shape of what was casted before.
3. **Thorny Vine** - 2 players will be **tethered together** which must be broken by running the **full length** of the platform.
	> Start by **grouping together** in your corner.
		>> - If you are **tethered**, use the movement priority and start running **horizontally** across the arena if you're the **lower priority**.
		>> - If you **aren't tethered**, **make space** for the tethered player on your side.
	![](/images/cod-playertether.webp)
:::

After **Thorny Vine** is resolved, an on-screen alert will appear signifying that **Cloud of Darkness** is charging an attack. This can either be **24 spread AoEs** or **6 light party beams** that target each **healer**.

- If you see **swirling black orbs** around her, she is charging the **spread AoEs**.

- If you see an **orange glow** around her, she is charging the **light party beams**.
	- **Inner players** should stack in their corner.
	- **Outer players** should stack on the platform, except for the D3 and D4, who should instead run along the **outer ring** to be in-line with the inner players' **light party beams**.

#### Active-Pivot Particle Beam
**Cloud of Darkness** will begin casting **Active-Pivot Particle Beam**, 2 line AoEs that fire **East** + **West** and rotate 90° either clockwise or counter-clockwise, with the final beams firing **North** + **South**.

::: details Outer Platforms
1. **Core-Lateral**/**Lateral-Core Phaser** - Each shadow will jump to the outer **East**/**West** edge and perform a **2-part attack**, sequentially cleaving her sides and front based on the cast bar.
	>> - **Core-Lateral** - She will cleave her **front**, then her **sides**.
	>> - **Lateral-Core** - She will cleave her **sides**, then her **front**.
	> - Dodge appropriately, then move opposite of the rotation of **Active-Pivot Particle Beam**.
2. **Excrutiate** - Each shadow will cast an AoE tankbuster on the main threat.
:::

::: details Inner Platforms
1. Players will resolve the rotation staying on their **East**/**West** side.
	- Players **at-risk** of being hit by the beams' rotation will shuffle towards the safe **North** or **South** corner accordingly, **"crossing"** the initial danger zone and keeping the movement priority in mind.
	- Players **not at-risk** of being hit should make space by having the tank shuffle over, while the other two tuck into the corner spots.
2. As the beams **resolve**, players can shuffle back into their corners, like so.

#### Looming Chaos
**Looming Chaos** will tether 2 players from across the arena and swap their positions. There's a general **logic** that we can use to our advantage to have as **little impact** as possible on roles and positions. The general logic is:
- **6 players** on the inner platform will swap with each other, **staying** on the inner platform.
- **6 players** on the inner platform will swap with the furthest **6 players** from themselves.
- **6 players** on the outer platform will swap with each other, **staying** on the outer platform.

This means there'll be about **12 players** swapping platforms **mechanically**, from out to in and vice versa. This is why it's recommended to read **both sides** as mentioned before, to prepare you for any **repeating** mechanics you may not have done **before the swap**.

The positions we'll be taking look like **this**:

![](/images/cod-looming.webp)

This is to ensure that the roles of the **6 players** swapping out of the inner platform (**2 tanks**, **2 healers** and **2 DPS**) will stay consistent by swapping with the **6 furthest players** away from them (the **2 tanks**, **2 healers** and **2 DPS** on the **East**/**West** edge).

::: tank
Remember to **provoke** your new target after swapping positions.
:::

::: damage
If you were a **DPS** on the **inner platform** and were **swapped** with someone on the **outer platform**, you'll now be considered the D3 of that group for the rest of the phase, **regardless** of job. Keep this in mind when **reading** and looking at **diagram positions**.
:::

After the swap, the **Stygian Shadows** will cast **Core-Lateral**/**Lateral-Core Phaser** again, while **Cloud of Darkness** starts casting [**Particle Concentration**](#particle-concentration) again. Resolve the cleaves, then fill the towers.

#### Feint Particle Beam
::: details Outer Platforms
1. **Third Art of Darkness** - Each shadow will cast a **3-part sequence** of attacks, telegraphed by the amount of glowing orbs she holds up each time.

	| 1 Orb | 2 Orbs | No Orb/Boss Glows |
	| :---: | :---: | :---: |
	| **180° cleave** on glowing orb's side. | Pair stacks on the **3 closest** players. | Beam **spreads**. |
	| ![](/images/cod-p2cleave.webp) | ![](/images/cod-p2pairs.webp) | ![](/images/cod-p2spread.webp) |

	> - A sequence will always be made up of **2 180° cleaves** and **1 pair**/**spread**.
	> - Use the positions above to resolve, mirroring the positions of the **pair**/**spread** if on the **East** platform.
	> - Resolve the pair stacks **before** crossing over to dodge a 180° cleave.
:::

::: details Inner Platform
1. **Feint Particle Beam** - **1 player** in each corner will be marked with a **fast chasing AoE**.
	> - Players marked should run **clockwise immediately** around the inner platform.
	> - **Everyone** should create space ahead of time by leaving the **clockwise pathway free to travel**, like so.
	![](/images/cod-feint.webp)
:::

The phase will close out with repeated mechanics:
1. **Ghastly Gloom**
2. **Core-Lateral**/**Lateral-Core Phaser**
3. **24 Player Spread**/**6 Light Party Beams**
4. **Flood of Darkness (Interruptible)**

Phase 1 will repeat with the unused sequence, and then the boss will enrage.
