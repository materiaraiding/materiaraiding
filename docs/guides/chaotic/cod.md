## Fight Summary
Guide written by Pod

### Opening
Cloud of Darkness will open by using **Blade of Darkness** twice, a telegraphed cleave AoE with 3 variable safe spots depending on the glowing arm she raises.

- If she raises **one** glowing arm, she will swipe the entire arena but leave a small safe spot next to her other arm.
- If she raises **both** glowing arms, she will swipe a large circular area in front of her, requiring players to get away.

::: info NOTE
Getting hit by the cleave only results in Sustained Damage; be mindful of your healing tools if you intend to eat the cleave for uptime.
:::

### Phase 1
Phase 1 is primarily about staying on your feet and keeping track of both your **Grim Embrace** debuff and any stored **Aero IV**/**Death IV** casts before they catch you unaware.

::: tank
For the entirety of this phase, her auto attacks will target the highest enmity player in each alliance and apply a **stacking vulnerability**.

It's recommended to use some of your personal mitigation for extended periods of auto attacks and swap threat with your co-tank every 4-6 stacks.
:::

::: everyone
In this phase, Cloud of Darkness will take increased damage. Try to deal as much damage as you can here through bursts, potions and even **LB3**.
:::

Cloud of Darkness starts by casting **Grim Embrace** twice, tethering half the raid with each cast and applying a debuff that will summon a hand facing towards you when it expires. This hand lunges in the direction it's facing, and how it faces you is determined by her animation when she is casting the attack.

> - Her hand is **under** the crystal; the hand will spawn **behind** you. Step **backwards** when it spawns.

> - Her hand is **in front** of the crystal; the hand will spawn **in front** of you. Step **forwards** when it spawns.
> ![](/images/cod-handfront.webp)

Throughout the phase these debuffs will resolve in batches, requiring players to break away from the raid so as to not hit other players.

::: healer
Players hit by the hands will get a cleansable Doom. Have Esuna on hand, ready to cleanse anyone hit.
:::

**Cloudlets of Darkness** will spawn with an on-screen alert, manifesting in the back of the arena and shooting linear beams in 4 sets. Use the tiles on the ground to help you dodge these.

From here, the sequence of mechanics splits into two, with one sequence playing out here and the other sequence playing out after Phase 2.
