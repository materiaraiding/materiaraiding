### Notes
- You can bait Phases of the Blade to always be N/S with the Tanks at North and the Party stacking South
- Double Meteor DPS / Tank Flare North vs South
       DPS 3 tower will always be North
       TH 2 tower will always be South
       To be more consistent, DPS Flare -> North, TH Flare -> South
- Terrastorm using different Light parties vs G1 + G2
       Similarly to p8s dog 2 Diflare, we put D1D2 at the front for melee uptime.
