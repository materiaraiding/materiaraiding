## 

Dungeon content can be split into **2 categories**:

### Criterion

A difficulty existing since **Endwalker**. Each **Criterion** remixes its respective **Variant** dungeon into a sequence of several small-scale encounters, with checkpoints in between and a single-use **resurrection** per pull.

**Criterion (Savage)** introduces additional restrictions, such as the removal of checkpoints and resurrections among other changes to both damage numbers and enemy telegraphs.

**Criterions** use the "**Another**" prefix, or the "**A**" prefix in acronym form.

### Quantum

A difficulty introduced in **Dawntrail**. **Quantum** allows players to use different **offerings** to scale the difficulty of the duty to their liking, with the maximum difficulty leaning towards a small-scale **Ultimate**.

**Quantums** use the "**(Quantum)**" suffix, or the "**Q**" suffix in acronym form.
