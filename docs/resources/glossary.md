# Glossary
This glossary contains common terms and phrases used in the game, particularly in relation to raids and mechanics. It is intended to help players understand the terminology used in guides, discussions, and other resources.


## Encounter

### General

| **Abbreviation** | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **iLvl**          | "Item Level" is a property of gear that reflects the approximate effectiveness of the item. It is not the level required to equip the item. |
| **BiS**           | "Best-in-Slot" refers to specific equipment pieces at a given item level that result in optimal performance for a character. |
| **DPS**           | "Damage Per Second" is a metric used to measure the amount of damage output a character can deal over time. It is also commonly used to refer to the collective role of melee, physical ranged, and magical ranged damage-dealing jobs in a group. |
| **MT**            | "Main Tank" is the role assigned to the tank responsible for maintaining aggro on the boss for the majority of the fight. This role typically goes to the tank with higher personal sustain and a less hectic burst window, although exceptions exist. |
| **OT**            | "Off Tank" is the role assigned to the second tank in a group. Their primary responsibility does not involve initially drawing the boss's aggro but rather handling other aspects of tanking, such as add control or off-tank mechanics. |
| **H1**            | "Healer One" is a role assigned to one of the healers in a group to differentiate between them for mechanic assignments. This role typically favors pure healers like White Mage or Astrologian. |
| **H2**            | "Healer Two" is a role assigned to one of the healers in a group to differentiate between them for mechanic assignments. This role typically favors shield healers such as Scholar or Sage. |
| **D1**            | "DPS One" is a role assigned to one of the DPS players for mechanic assignments. This role typically favors melee DPS jobs like Monk, Dragoon, Ninja, Samurai, or Reaper. |
| **D2**            | "DPS Two" is a role assigned to one of the DPS players for mechanic assignments. It is a flex slot, often given to another melee DPS job. |
| **D3**            | "DPS Three" is a role assigned to one of the DPS players for mechanic assignments, typically favoring physical ranged DPS jobs like Bard, Machinist, or Dancer. |
| **D4**            | "DPS Four" is a role assigned to one of the DPS players for mechanic assignments, typically favoring magical ranged DPS jobs like Black Mage, Summoner, or Red Mage. |

### Mechanics

| **Abbreviation**      | **Description** |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| **AoE**               | "Area-of-Effect" is a term often used to describe any mechanic or ability that impacts multiple enemies or players within a defined area. |
| **Stack/Soak**        | "Stack" or "Soak" refers to a mechanic that necessitates the party or a specific number of players to gather together in close proximity to share the damage inflicted by an attack or ability. |
| **Spread**            | "Spread" signifies a mechanic that requires party members to disperse and position themselves apart from each other to prevent overlapping damage or adverse effects. |
| **Telegraph/Broadcast** | "Telegraph" or "Broadcast" is a term used to describe the visual indicators displayed before a mechanic or ability activates. These indicators can include orange circles or lines on the ground, markers above player or enemy heads, or any other visual cue that signals an impending action. In more challenging content like Ultimates, some mechanics may not telegraph, necessitating players to rely on other cues such as cast bars. |
| **PB-AoE**            | "Point-Blank Area-of-Effect" typically denotes an enemy ability that generates a significant AoE damage area centered directly on the enemy itself. |
| **Chariot**           | "Chariot" describes a large circular AoE effect that encompasses the boss's immediate vicinity. |
| **Dynamo**            | "Dynamo" denotes a large donut-shaped AoE effect that surrounds the boss, with a safe zone in the center. |
| **Defamation**        | "Defamation" refers to a large circular AoE centered on a specific player, requiring nearby allies to react accordingly. |
| **Protean**           | "Protean" describes cone-shaped AoEs that target several or all players in a raid group, necessitating precise positioning and movement to avoid damage. |
| **Exaflare**          | "Exaflare" represents a mechanic involving delayed, sequential attacks that move in a specified direction. Typically, only the first explosion is visibly marked, requiring players to anticipate subsequent movements. |
| **Enums**             | "Enums" describe mechanics that require a specific number of players to participate in soaking the damage or effects. Similar to "Stack/Soak" mechanics, but with a predetermined player count involved. |

## Party Finder

### Progression

| **Term**     | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Fresh**    | In the Party Finder, "Fresh" denotes that it's a group's initial attempt at a specific encounter. You are welcome to join these groups regardless of your current progress level. |
| **Prog**     | "Progression" in the Party Finder signifies that a group is actively working on mastering a particular mechanic within an encounter. Often, the mechanic's name is specified, like 'LC1 prog.' Feel free to join these groups if your progress matches or exceeds their current level. |
| **Cleanup**  | Within the Party Finder, "Cleanup" indicates a group's focus on refining their execution of a specific mechanic within an encounter. Like "Prog," this term may include the mechanic's name, such as 'LC1 cleanup.' You can join these groups if your progress aligns with theirs or is more advanced. |
| **A2C**      | "Aim-to-Clear" or "Advance-to-Clear" in the Party Finder signifies a group that has successfully cleared all mechanics and is confident in their ability to achieve a clear. If you are not proficient in all fight mechanics, avoid joining these groups. |
| **C41**      | "Clear-for-one" in the Party Finder indicates that one member of the group has not yet obtained their clear and is seeking assistance to progress past challenging content. When joining these parties, it's reasonable to expect that you'll be contributing more than your fair share to ensure success. Occasionally, you might come across "C4N" parties, where 'N' represents any number greater than one. The overall concept remains the same, but it's advisable to exercise caution when joining such parties if you lack patience. Consider joining at your own discretion. |
| **Reclear**  | In the Party Finder, "Reclear" designates a group that has already cleared an encounter and is seeking to obtain weekly loot. If you haven't cleared the encounter yet or lack confidence in consistent clears, it's best not to join these groups. |
| **Parse**    | "Parse" in the Party Finder indicates a group that has cleared an encounter and is aiming to maximize their damage output. Only join these groups if you are confident in your clearing abilities; typically, they may also require the best-in-slot gear. |


### Loot

| **Term**    | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **FFA**     | "Free For All" is a loot rule where participants are allowed to roll freely on any item they desire. You can "Need" on everything without restrictions. |
| **L>R**     | "Left-to-Right" is a loot rule indicating that participants should roll "Need" on items in sequence from left to right. If you win a roll and receive an item, you are expected to exit the instance and refrain from rolling on additional items. This rule aims to ensure fair distribution of loot. |
| **Any Chest** | "Any Chest" is not so much a loot rule as it is an invitation to join the group, irrespective of whether you've already obtained your weekly duty reward. Sometimes, you may see "1 chest" specified, which suggests that between 1 and 4 group members have already received their weekly reward. In such cases, it's advisable to ask the group leader if there's room for additional participants who have also received their reward for the week. |
| **Book**    | "Book" indicates that you are welcome to join the group, regardless of whether you've already collected your weekly duty reward. The key difference here is that no chests are expected to drop; the primary goal of joining such a party is to obtain your weekly book reward. |
