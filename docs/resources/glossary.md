### General Mechanics

You may have heard these terms from other MMOs or video games - they apply to FFXIV as well.

| **Abbreviation**      | **Description** |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| **AoE**               | "Area-of-Effect" is a term often used to describe any mechanic or ability that impacts multiple enemies or players within a defined area. |
| **Stack/Soak**        | "Stack" or "Soak" refers to a mechanic that necessitates the party or a specific number of players to gather together in close proximity to share the damage inflicted by an attack or ability. |
| **Spread**            | "Spread" signifies a mechanic that requires party members to disperse and position themselves apart from each other to prevent overlapping damage or adverse effects. |
| **Telegraph/Broadcast** | "Telegraph" or "Broadcast" is a term used to describe the visual indicators displayed before a mechanic or ability activates. These indicators can include orange circles or lines on the ground, markers above player or enemy heads, or any other visual cue that signals an impending action. In more challenging content like Ultimates, some mechanics may not telegraph, necessitating players to rely on other cues such as cast bars. |
| **PB-AoE**            | "Point-Blank Area-of-Effect" typically denotes an enemy ability that generates a significant AoE damage area centered directly on the enemy itself. |

### FFXIV Jargon

FFXIV players like to reuse the names of mechanics seen in older fights to refer to 'similar' mechanics in newer fights. If you do not know the origin of these terms, they are understandably confusing so hopefully this table clears some of them up.

| **Term**      | **Description** |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Enumerations**   | "Enumerations" (enums for short) describe mechanics that require a specific number of players to participate in soaking the damage or effects. Similar to "Stack/Soak" mechanics, but with a predetermined player count involved. The stack marker usually has orbs that indicate the required amount of players. |
| **Chariot**           | "Chariot" is a large AoE circle around the boss - dodge by moving 'out.'<br>Originates from "Iron Chariot" in T9. |
| **Dynamo**            | "Dynamo" is a large donut-shaped AoE that surrounds the boss, with a safe zone in the center - dodge by moving 'in.'<br>Originates from "Lunar Dynamo" in T9. |
| **Defamation**        | "Defamation" is a large circular AoE centered on a specific player, requiring them to be very distant from the party.<br>Originates from A12S. |
| **Protean**           | "Protean" describes cone-shaped AoEs that target several or all players in a raid group that need to be dodged. May originate from the boss or an add.<br>Originates from "Protean Wave" in A3. |
| **Exas**          | "Exas" refer to a mechanic involving delayed, sequential AoEs that move in a specified direction. Typically, only the first explosion is visibly marked, requiring players to anticipate subsequent movements. Circular exas are generally known as Exaflares, but names can vary depending on the shape of the moving AoE (e.g. Exalines, Exasquares)<br>Originates from "Exaflare" in UCoB. |
| **Limit Cut** | "Limit Cut" refers to a mechanic that involves numbered dots or shapes appearing on players' heads, signifying the order they will be hit by a mechanic.<br>Originates from A11S. |
| **Akh Morn** | "Akh Morn" refers to a multi-hit AoE attack (may be a party stack or tankbuster depending on the encounter). Common attack seen in encounters with draconic enemies. |
| **Pyretic / Stillness** | A debuff (generally fire-themed) or castbar that incidates the player must be completely still at the end of the timer to avoid damage / death. May also be in the form an of "Acceleration Bomb" debuff. |
| **Deep Freeze / Motion** | A debuff (generally ice-themed) or castbar that indicates the player must be moving at the end of the timer to avoid damage / death. |
| **Trio** | A "Trio" is a mechanic where the boss becomes untargetable and alongside some other untargetable adds, dishes out a series of mechanics.<br>Originates from the names of P3 mechanics in UCoB. |

## Party Finder

### Progression

| **Term**     | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Fresh**    | In the Party Finder, "Fresh" denotes that it's a group's initial attempt at a specific encounter. You are welcome to join these groups regardless of your current progress level. |
| **Prog**     | "Progression" in the Party Finder signifies that a group is actively working on mastering a particular mechanic within an encounter. Often, the mechanic's name is specified, like 'LC1 prog.' Feel free to join these groups if your progress matches or exceeds their current level. |
| **Cleanup**  | Within the Party Finder, "Cleanup" indicates a group's focus on refining their execution of a specific mechanic within an encounter. Like "Prog," this term may include the mechanic's name, such as 'LC1 cleanup.' You can join these groups if your progress aligns with theirs or is more advanced. |
| **A2C**      | "Aim-to-Clear" or "Advance-to-Clear" in the Party Finder signifies a group that has successfully cleared all mechanics and is confident in their ability to achieve a clear. If you are not proficient in all fight mechanics, avoid joining these groups. |
| **C41**      | "Clear-for-one" in the Party Finder indicates that one member of the group has not yet obtained their clear and is seeking assistance to progress past challenging content. When joining these parties, it's reasonable to expect that you'll be contributing more than your fair share to ensure success. Occasionally, you might come across "C4N" parties, where 'N' represents any number greater than one. The overall concept remains the same, but it's advisable to exercise caution when joining such parties if you lack patience. Consider joining at your own discretion. |
| **Reclear**  | In the Party Finder, "Reclear" designates a group that has already cleared an encounter and is seeking to obtain weekly loot. If you haven't cleared the encounter yet or lack confidence in consistent clears, it's best not to join these groups. |
| **Parse**    | "Parse" in the Party Finder indicates a group that has cleared an encounter and is aiming to maximize their damage output. Only join these groups if you are confident in your clearing abilities; typically, they may also require the best-in-slot gear. |


### Loot

| **Term**    | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **FFA**     | "Free For All" is a loot rule where participants are allowed to roll freely on any item they desire. You can "Need" on everything without restrictions. |
| **L>R**     | "Left-to-Right" is a loot rule indicating that participants should roll "Need" on items in sequence from left to right. If you win a roll and receive an item, you are expected to exit the instance and refrain from rolling on additional items. This rule aims to ensure fair distribution of loot. |
| **Any Chest** | "Any Chest" is not so much a loot rule as it is an invitation to join the group, irrespective of whether you've already obtained your weekly duty reward. Sometimes, you may see "1 chest" specified, which suggests that between 1 and 4 group members have already received their weekly reward. In such cases, it's advisable to ask the group leader if there's room for additional participants who have also received their reward for the week. |
| **Book**    | "Book" indicates that you are welcome to join the group, regardless of whether you've already collected your weekly duty reward. The key difference here is that no chests are expected to drop; the primary goal of joining such a party is to obtain your weekly book reward. |
