# The Beginners Guide to Raiding

This guide is intended to introduce you to the basics of High-End Duty content in FF14 and is intended for new players who are interested in trying out harder content.

## What is High-End Raiding in FFXIV?

High-End Duty content in Final Fantasy XIV refers to the most challenging instanced encounters in the game, designed for experienced players seeking difficult mechanics and rewarding loot. These duties include:

- **Savage Raids**: Harder versions of normal raids with complex mechanics and strict execution requirements.

- **Extreme Trials**: Tougher versions of standard trials, often featuring unique mechanics and valuable rewards.

- **Ultimate Raids**: The pinnacle of difficulty in FFXIV, requiring near-perfect execution and teamwork.

- **Criterion Dungeons**: High-difficulty dungeon content with unique mechanics and a savage mode for special cosmetics.

- **Unreal Trials**: Revamped versions of older extreme trials, adjusted to modern difficulty standards.

- **Chaotic Raid**: Newer large scale 24 man raids with complex mechanics based on older alliance raids.

These duties typically release in cycles alongside major patches and expansions, offering powerful gear, titles, and cosmetic rewards. 
Players can tackle them via Party Finder or by joining a Static Group, which is a dedicated team that regularly raids together.

### Difficulty

High-End Content varies in difficulty greatly, generally these are ranked as follows from least to most challenging content:

1. Unreal
2. Extreme
3. Chaotic
4. Savage / Criterion
5. Ultimate

::: tip
If you are a new player who has never taken part in High-End Duty, we recommend starting with **Extreme** as this is the best entry point to learn new systems and mechanics in a lower-stress environment.

Extreme trials will introduce you to basics of party roles, mechanics and the terminology used in raiding. This will give you a taste of what to expect in Savage and Ultimate raiding.

::: warning
As Unreal Trials are generally a more seasonal event, these are usually not considered an entry-point for new players getting into raiding and can be heavily cheesed.

### Release Cycle

High-End Duty content in Final Fantasy XIV follows a structured release cycle tied to major patches and expansions. Here's how it typically works:

| Content Type   | Release Cycle                                                                                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Savage Raids   | Released two weeks after a new expansion or major patch, allowing players time to complete the normal version first. |
| Extreme Trials | Usually launched on day one of an expansion or major patch as these are tied to MSQ releases.                        |
| Ultimate Raids | Introduced several months after an expansion or major patch, Typically two ultimates will release per expansion.     |
| Criterion Dungeons | Added in mid-patches, offering a fresh challenge between major content updates. Unpredictable as they were only recently added in Endwalker. |
| Unreal Trials | Updated periodically with most major patches, replacing older trials with revamped versions. |

Savage Raids are the core of FF14 Raiding and release in 3 sets of 4, known as **Tiers**. Each releasing on patch x.0, x.2 and x.4. Each Tier is made up of 4 Trial-like fights where you face off against a single boss. 

### Rewards

High-End Duties in Final Fantasy XIV offer a variety of rewards depending on the type of content. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

- **Unreal, Ultimate and Criterion**: Primarily cosmetic rewards and do not play a part in the gearing of your character.
- **Savage**: Provides the highest-stat gear in the game and tokens that can be used to purchase gear or upgrades for tomestone gear.
- **Extreme**: Rewards weapons that are best for the beginning of a raid tier along with other cosmetic rewards.
- **Chaotic**: Provides strong gear that can be useful in preparing alt jobs for raiding. 

Savage Raids and Extreme Trials are the core of FF14's gearing system, and it is important to know how these work, this will be explained in greater detail further down.

## Finding a Party

There are two ways you can get a party together for High-End Duty content. 

- Form a Static: A group of players who raid together on a regular schedule with the same roster.
- Use Party Finder: Ad-hoc parties formed using the in-game party finder tool.

There are pros and cons to both approaches, this will ultimately depend on your own availability, commitment and goals.

### What is a Static?

A Static is a dedicated group of players who regularly play together to tackle high-end content like Savage Raids, Criterion Dungeons, and Ultimate Raids. Instead of relying on Party Finder, **statics provide a consistent team with established schedules, strategies, and goals**.

Statics are generally only used for the most challenging High-End Duties, as these do require consistency and regular practice to clear reliably. Most Statics will form a few weeks or months prior to the release of a new Savage Raid tier or Ultimate.

A static might follow the regions standard strats or may use their own developed strats for a fight, this will depend on when they progged the fight.

A static is generally considered the **fastest way to clear a tier** and can also guarantee you will get all the loot you need eventually as your team can target loot to players strategically.

## Preparation

Prior to instancing into a raid, there are several things you need to prepare for - gear, consumables, knowing your class's general rotation and studying for the encounter you intend to do (unless you have joined a "blind" PF or static). 

### Gear and Melding

If you are raiding at the beginning of a tier, you want to be wielding the newest crafted gear that is overmelded with 5 materia. You may have some pieces from the extreme / normal raid and as you obtain tome and raid gear you can replace the lower iLvl piece. You must always have all pieces of gear fully melded if you to enter a raid.

**The Balance** Discord will provide you with information on your job's Week 1 BiS, as well as the final raid BiS.

To obtain crafted gear: you can craft it yourself, buy it off the Market Board or have someone else craft it for you.

To overmeld your gear:
- You must have 1 Disciple of the Hand (crafter) job at max level as this allows you to meld your own gear.
- You must complete this [full quest chain(https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Forging_the_Spirit)] that eventually teaches overmelding.

As overmelding gear is a gambling process, you will need a lot of materia. Regularly attending A rank hunt trains (which you can track in the Faloop Discord) is the best way to obtain clusters (which you exchange for materia). Otherwise, your other immediate option is to buy them from the Market Board which becomes expensive very quickly.

If for some reason you absolutely cannot achieve Week 1 BiS and intend on doing early prog:
- If you are in a static, let them know. However they choose to handle that is up to the static.
- If you intend to PF, please respect other people's time and do not join parties with undergeared and unmelded jobs. People want to give themselves the best chance to progress and having bad gear will undermine that.

If you begin raiding later in the tier, as long as you are fully melded with current tome, crafted or normal raid gear, that is acceptable.

### Consumables

You must have current high quality food up and running during a raid. Food buffs give you extra health and a boost in 2 specific stats - they last 30 minutes (40 with FC buffs and 45 with a manual). The ideal food for your job is information available on The Balance Discord.

You must also carry current high quality potions with you. For extreme and savage, you are not expected to use them during early prog and can save them for final mech prog / A2C / reclears. For ultimates, especially on-content encounters, it is expected that pots are used even during prog at specific points to meet a phase's DPS check. Individual encounters may have unique pot windows but in general, use them when available at the beginning of a 2 minute burst window.

**People can see if you are not using your consumables so don't try to get away with this.**

You can craft these consumables yourself, have someone else craft them for you or buy them from the Market Board.

### Understanding your Class

coming soon

### Studying

If there are resources available and agreed strategies to solve mechanics for a particular encounter, it is paramount to be familiar with them before instancing into the encounter. Of course, it is normal to make mistakes while practicing physically executing the mechanic, but do not come into raid without having idea what you are supposed to do.

Your static may provide you with the resources you need for studying, but many statics try to match PF strategies for compatability. For PF strategies, the Materia Raiding Discord has resources including raidplans / toolboxes (visual diagrams of how to resolve a mechanic).

::: warning 
If you are jumping into PF week 1, **expect strats to change multiple times** and regularly check the Materia Raiding Discord until strategies are 100% set in stone.
:::

Studying goes beyond simply looking at raidlpans - POVs are essential to put these diagrams into context. Do your best to also understand *why* the mechanic plays out - having a proper understanding of the mechanic (as opposed to looking at the raidplan purely to understand where to stand) will make you a better and more competent raider. As mentioned before, it is disrespectful to other party members and their time to show up underprepared so please study adequately.

How much you need to study depends on the encounter itself or static expectations. Generally speaking, you want to study *at least* 1 phase ahead of your prog point. Again, the definition of a phase will depend on the encounter itself, but just study as much as possible!

The only exception to a study requirement is if you are in a blind PF or static (i.e. the party intends to solve the encounter themselves without any resources)
